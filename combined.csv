Accept and Confirm;Alright.
Accept and Confirm;Alright. Okay
Accept and Confirm;Alright.1
Accept and Confirm;I believe we can.
Accept and Confirm;It seems like it
Accept and Confirm;It's distributed, okay.

Accept and Confirm;Right.
Accept and Confirm;Right.
Accept and Confirm;Right.
Accept and Confirm;Right.
Accept and Confirm;Right.
Accept and Confirm;Right. Exactly.
Accept and Confirm;Right. Okay
Accept and Confirm;so maybe this is public and this is private in the sensethat you only ever have roads in the network when it's at theintersections because I don't think, I'm trying to
Accept and Confirm;So they can build on.
Accept and Confirm;So, controller -ê okay
Accept and Confirm;Sure. Sure, so let's establish
Accept and Confirm;That's right.
Accept and Confirm;That's true.
Accept and Confirm;Well, that could be, maybe the cop -
Accept and Confirm;Yeah

Accept and Confirm;Yeah sure
Accept and Confirm;Yeah there could be two
Accept and Confirm;Yeah,
Accept and Confirm;Yeah, 
Accept and Confirm;Yeah,
Accept and Confirm;Yeah,
Accept and Confirm;Yeah,
Accept and Confirm;Yeah,
Accept and Confirm;Yeah,
Accept and Confirm;Yeah,
Accept and Confirm;Yeah,
Accept and Confirm;Yeah,
Accept and Confirm;Yeah, exactly. 
Accept and Confirm;Yeah, it's a little messy
Accept and Confirm;Yeah, it's a lot of rules, right.
Accept and Confirm;Yeah, right, right
Accept and Confirm;Yeah, right. Right
Accept and Confirm;Yeah, that makes sense
Accept and Confirm;Yeah, that's right.
Accept and Confirm;Yeah, yeah
Accept and Confirm;Yeah.
Accept and Confirm;Yeah.
Accept and Confirm;Yeah. 
Accept and Confirm;Yeah.
Accept and Confirm;You're right, so let's write it
Acknowledge;A queue of cars, right
Acknowledge;Alright
Acknowledge;Alright.
Acknowledge;Alright. Okay
Acknowledge;Alright.1
Acknowledge;cop, we'd have kind of a cop object that youcould manipulate certain rule sets. Or is that implicit in[inaudible
Acknowledge;I believe we can.
Acknowledge;it has a tick and the tick method really then says I thinkwe're going to time this happened, I'm going to go check my[inaudible] and I'm going to kick off, so its like we're sayingthat this is a traverser.
Acknowledge;It seems like it
Acknowledge;It's almost like the intersection has a state
Acknowledge;It's distributed, okay.
Acknowledge;My first inclination is to say, okay the rules if rules can getpushed into the objects and then tick maybe into the--distribute the rules into the network and then at every tickeach aspect, each car gets a tick, each intersection gets atick, each road gets a tick.
Acknowledge;No
Acknowledge;Oh, right
Acknowledge;Okay
Acknowledge;Okay 
Acknowledge;Okay
Acknowledge;okay
Acknowledge;Okay
Acknowledge;Okay

Acknowledge;Okay 
Acknowledge;Okay
Acknowledge;Okay
Acknowledge;Okay
Acknowledge;Okay
Acknowledge;Okay
Acknowledge;Okay
Acknowledge;Okay
Acknowledge;Okay
Acknowledge;Okay
Acknowledge;Okay so 
Acknowledge;Okay,
Acknowledge;Okay, alright
Acknowledge;Okay, I like that.
Acknowledge;Okay, yeah.
Acknowledge;Okay.
Acknowledge;Okay.
Acknowledge;Okay.
Acknowledge;random number generator is controlling push. Andthat happens for every tick.
Acknowledge;Right
Acknowledge;Right

Acknowledge;Right, yeah
Acknowledge;Right.
Acknowledge;Right.
Acknowledge;Right.
Acknowledge;Right.
Acknowledge;Right.
Acknowledge;Right.
Acknowledge;Right. Exactly.
Acknowledge;Right. Okay
Acknowledge;so maybe this is public and this is private in the sensethat you only ever have roads in the network when it's at theintersections because I don't think, I'm trying to
Acknowledge;So they can build on.
Acknowledge;So, controller -ê okay
Acknowledge;Sure. Sure, so let's establish
Acknowledge;That's right.
Acknowledge;That's true.
Acknowledge;There might be an implicitstep in the network to say to keep the network modelconstraints by introducing an intersection if it needs to at ajunction
Acknowledge;Well that's a good point, though, 
Acknowledge;Well, that could be, maybe the cop -
Acknowledge;Yeah
Acknowledge;Yeah
Acknowledge;Yeah

Acknowledge;Yeah, right, right
Acknowledge;Yeah, right. Right
Acknowledge;Yeah, that makes sense
Acknowledge;Yeah, that's right.
Acknowledge;Yeah, yeah
Acknowledge;Yeah.
Acknowledge;Yeah. 
Acknowledge;Yeah.
Acknowledge;Yeah.
Acknowledge;You're right, so let's write it
Agree;I think you're right saying the light knows the state of is therea car there
Agree;That's true. 
Appreciation;Well that's a good point, though, 
Argue; but it's not necessarily realistic
Argue; But the light would then have to 
Argue; But then there's 
Argue; But you know 
Argue; I don't know 
Argue; I don't know how to actually structure this
Argue; if we control whether certain intersections evenallow a [inaudible
Argue; it should bepossible to create a busy road or a seldom used one, or any 0variation in between.
Argue; Okay so it says that's up to us
Argue; Or, at leastde
Argue; so dowe want to have visualization of cars moving along aparticular road in a geometric sense? 
Argue; so now the push is not just the random numbergenerator for frequency, but there's also random numbergenerator for zero one for left versus right
Argue; wonder if atfirst approximation never [inaudible] in roads. 
Argue;, but whatabout the--how 
Argue;. So add road could potentially have, what's theplace you could ever, you did this.
Argue;. Which would be a horizontalflow or a vertical flow
Argue;and have uml diagram for the class structureof each object's attributes
Argue;And I wonder
Argue;aroad is an interior or we should call it an onramp
Argue;but 
Argue;But
Argue;but also it'sanalytic data saying okay you're still in this queue
Argue;but beginning when youjust 
Argue;But I imagine the controller controls that, right, the modelbasically is just the basically cars, the queue of cars, theintersection contains four queues.
Argue;But I think that would become a bit spaghetti 
Argue;But if you 
Argue;but let's leave observe 
Argue;But not necessarilyall red.
Argue;but only if 
Argue;But roads
Argue;but should readily accommodate six intersections--okayso we can actually accommodate [inaudible] larger
Argue;but that, but this simulation 
Argue;But the push is really 
Argue;but then let's
Argue;but then there's horizontal-êleft,vertical-êleft.
Argue;but then we can 
Argue;but we've 
Argue;But what 
Argue;Butthen
Argue;butwhat's--I'd imagine 
Argue;cop, we'd have kind of a cop object that youcould manipulate certain rule sets. Or is that implicit in[inaudible
Argue;create a road there's no intersection, so road existsoutside of the intersection
Argue;Do you want to keep it or do you want to do two queues.
Argue;I don't know
Argue;I don't know if this isany better
Argue;I mean I'm wondering could youadd
Argue;I suppose if you just had a list of intersections it goesrandomly too 
Argue;I think you're right saying the light knows the state of is therea car there
Argue;I wonder if 
Argue;If it's a single lane of traffic, could those left-êturners andstraight-êthrough-êers be queued up in the same queue
Argue;If that state is this, then the otherstates are going to be
Argue;If the car at thehead of, well the entrance. I guess
Argue;if there's a protected left turn thenthese need to be broken up almost.
Argue;if they have an intersection here and here
Argue;if this is ourcanvass and that's an onramp and that's an off ramp, youhave a special edge intersection
Argue;if this road fills up, then even if this is green,this car won't be able to pass
Argue;if we ever really neededthis 
Argue;If we had some sort of--our network can be representedwith a geometry that's in kind of the window so you canscroll around
Argue;if we haveintersection then they know about them
Argue;if we make the capacity of the geometry and youcould sort of simulate a highway or something
Argue;If we want to
Argue;if we want to get more sophisticated wecould have sensor logic taking sensor for each in-êroad so thatif say these two are empty then these two just stay greenforever
Argue;if we were playing the roles ofarchitect, how to communicate it to--so we
Argue;if you could rearrange the networks to get thatslope, you would have
Argue;if you double click you can controlthe frequency of the car creation on that road
Argue;if you gothrough that's fine and then through that's fine.
Argue;If you have multiple lanesthen you could say the left one is always turning left
Argue;if you look at a road. It has a queue, right
Argue;if you say you have to start with anonramp 
Argue;if you're thinking graphically, if this iscapacity and wait time, the capacity is going to be graphedsomething like that
Argue;if you're visiting anintersection and a road you don't have to be those thingsthere, all that logic is pretty clear there
Argue;if youwant to take control, I'd have you say 
Argue;Ifyou want to make it longer or shorter
Argue;I'm notquite sure 
Argue;is the cop really a model or is that acontroller
Argue;Is this all this sort of master control orwhatever? Or should that go into where you push rulesdown to
Argue;It depends if there's two lanes or not.
Argue;It has a tick, tick, tick, or are we saying that alltick logic methods have a combo
Argue;it might be, or another alternative
Argue;It would have multiple lanes so thatin a sense it has multiple queues
Argue;It's almost as if you need to always start with an onramp sothat
Argue;it's not full it would be allowed to
Argue;just wonder if maybe the important 
Argue;let's supposeto you do here to here onramp, off ramp. And so this pointnow we can get an interior, now we've got an interior.
Argue;let'ssuppose we make it so every ten ticks the lights change.Well, it might be that every five ticks, the sensor is triggered,or something like that.
Argue;Like so that you've got this intersection next to thisintersection and if this road fills up, then even 
Argue;Maybe ifyou select a car, I mean a road, it allows you to edit
Argue;now I'm wondering like the rule for changing the lights,we established a rule saying the light, are we going to saylight would change to green, or will only stay red for xamount of time, or is it reversed
Argue;Numerical decision data. Averagewait time, three hours. And I wonder if we want to allowuser control of a clock in the sense that relating the notion ofthis tick time to real time. 
Argue;okayone tick so from two to one, we go to zero 
Argue;One car or two
Argue;Or a left protection
Argue;Or analyzing the average wait time of a given car, right
Argue;Or are all the opposing lanesalways the same state
Argue;or are we lettingthe video camera capture that description
Argue;Or if 
Argue;or if we 
Argue;Or is this inside of a UI 
Argue;or we could even have 
Argue;or yeah I guess speed of cars, rate of incoming cars onthe onramp
Argue;Or you could say
Argue;Or you could start from the outside in and say, well for everyunbounded road,
Argue;Or you've got 
Argue;Or, I want to run it on--run a simulation for some amount oftime and evaluate the network
Argue;Or, wait. Well that's [inaudible] one cargoes per tick.
Argue;property of the queue or a property of thecar
Argue;Right so this is now a UI piece and the dot, brings up youreditor with frequency of, your frequency value
Argue;say if this is the head. Sothe speed controls, like for every tick how many spaces a carcan move
Argue;so
Argue;So all these lines of 
Argue;so clock is a controller
Argue;So do you want 
Argue;So for every tick, the analytics guy does asweep, collecting statistical data about the state of each tick
Argue;So foreach road in the simulation we look at the car at the head ofthe queue
Argue;so get rid of this 
Argue;So highlight 
Argue;So I 
Argue;so I can see traffic flow across it.
Argue;So I think that might bethe best way to communicate interaction design.
Argue;So I think that's 
Argue;So I was thinking 
Argue;So if the 
Argue;So I'll use a soliddot to mean ownership and then an open dot to meanreferencing. So the network owns the roads, the networkowns the intersections but the intersection can referencethese in and out roads. Alright, so I guess we need, addroad
Argue;So I'm thinking maybe
Argue;so instead of just a straight 
Argue;so is there someone looking at the networksaying the average congestion is, or the average wait time ofa car is,
Argue;So it might be thatthe road has some number of, an ordered list of cars that aremoving along the road and only when they get to the end ofthe road do they get pushed into the queue. 
Argue;So it should 
Argue;So it's a visit
Argue;So it's got to be just a grid likethat. That's fine.
Argue;So it's like8you're inferring intersection at crossings.
Argue;So it's saying at each tick we see where the problems occurand maybe make a road blink red if it's full and
Argue;So I've got two car lengths 
Argue;So let's 
Argue;so let's suppose T onerepresent a delta 
Argue;so max cars, holds n.1
Argue;So maybe 
Argue;So maybe it'sreally a function of the result of how the intersections arelaid out. And the relationship between the intersection. 8
Argue;so maybe this is public and this is private in the sensethat you only ever have roads in the network when it's at theintersections because I don't think, I'm trying to
Argue;so maybe we 
Argue;So mostly straight and sometimes 
Argue;so next userstory 
Argue;so that comes back toanalytics right?
Argue;So that kind of comes into car
Argue;so that thisintersection is connected to this one, or is that
Argue;So that would 
Argue;So that you 
Argue;So that's just the function or the property on thelight
Argue;so that's one thing, and also like how longthese signals stay green
Argue;So that's the basic way to kick it all off I guess
Argue;so the cop as, 
Argue;So the empty network is what we started outwith a blank page, as they drag a road on, that instantiates aroad object
Argue;So the only other way youcan get through
Argue;so the pop 
Argue;So the random number 
Argue;So then you drag 
Argue;So then, so suppose, so we're going to have thecars done in one tic right.
Argue;So therandom 
Argue;so there needs to be some logic about, wellthat's interesting so there's a notion of the road in, road out.
Argue;So there's through here, off ramp and onramp right
Argue;So this is interesting, so now should allow for roads of anylength to be placed
Argue;So this network or graph hasadditional constraints.
Argue;So this one piece of state we haven't captured is whether aroad is an interior or we should call it an onramp
Argue;So this whole thing we should talk about road, got this modelcontrol or 
Argue;So we 
Argue;So we almost don't need a--well, we need car to havesomething in the queue
Argue;so we could come 
Argue;So we makeroads, right. So one m of intersections and we would haveroad connected to the intersection or the intersection has2paths
Argue;So we makeroads, right. So one m of intersections and we would haveroad connected to the intersection or the intersection has2paths
Argue;so we need to communicate the interaction
Argue;So we want to, you know, does thishappen basically.
Argue;So wecould introduce a notion of speed into our queue
Argue;so we're 
Argue;So we're getting some credit collection of rules here
Argue;so we've created a basic [inaudible] for it to run in.
Argue;So we've got a great 
Argue;So when it comes 
Argue;So where you 
Argue;So you can't 
Argue;so you click an 
Argue;so you have a consistent road network.
Argue;So you have to explain
Argue;so you want the 
Argue;So youcould simplify 
Argue;So you're 
Argue;So you're just doing it 
Argue;So, go ahead
Argue;So, let's suppose we start with, say this picture is T zero.What would, okay so they can't, let's suppose for a momentthat T zero has all the lights about to change, so in the sensethat wherever I just point in time nothing's moving and we'reshowing x point in time where something has moved sort ofbefore and after state.
Argue;So, something happens as an external controller is ticking themodel
Argue;Sodoes it have a sensor, yes, no
Argue;somenumber of--so it has, think of this as kilometers, or carlengths. 
Argue;Sothat we 
Argue;sothis can be bigger than the window so scrolling, stuff likethat
Argue;Suppose you have even a simulationobject, it has a clock and a network and here's the clock andit tells the clock time
Argue;thatif a car went from here--so what we'd see right now in ourvisualization is that in queue we see it pop to the front of thequeue
Argue;That's true. 
Argue;then this guy would have a state. It's like okay I'vebeen in this state for two ticks, go to three don't change, goto four change, something like that. Right, so this guy has anotion of the state of the light but also time and currentstate, right. So, the clock ticks, the cop says look at whatlights are green, one tick means one car goes through so wepop off the end of the queue, we say the cop notices the endof the intersection has been in this state for one tick so nochange needs to be made. And then we get the same greenstate
Argue;There might be an implicitstep in the network to say to keep the network modelconstraints by introducing an intersection if it needs to at ajunction
Argue;there's rules governing if you have two carsgoing into the same road, which goes first per tick, 
Argue;this road is geometrically shorter, then thisessentially is saying all roads are the same length
Argue;This way, or that way
Argue;Ticks per minute, orsecond. Okay
Argue;We could do it that way. Either that or we could make roadsdominant and then intersections really just a thing thathappens at road crossings.
Argue;Well, I don't know
Argue;We're prettyconstrained in what we draw geometrically so it almostseems like it might be nice to [inaudible] the geometry fromthe simulation
Argue;We've kind of done it here, butit's kind of messy
Argue;when I hit theplay button, it kicks the ticks going and now we have all ofour random number generators feeding cars into thenetwork
Argue;you have an analyticspiece looking in and assessing questions like
Argue;you're trying to do the yield, you know trying tosimulate the yield rule, right
Assumption; And we have a green light. Not aleft-êgreen
Assumption; is really a random, saya random event in the sense that every tick he rolled a diceas to how many cars can queue up.
Assumption; So car equals left and I.light equalsyellow or .light equals left,
Assumption; visit intersection andthere's a visit called road, car, and then that, that's how wecode the logic. 
Assumption;A cop is kind of controlling the state of the model
Assumption;also don't need to push on herebecause the--this, you don't need to randomly push on herebecause all the cars coming in this queue are going to becoming from this road. Either from here, or from there.
Assumption;Analytic dataon an intersection saying how many cars are you pushingthrough on average.
Assumption;And as well as the signal
Assumption;And different logic on en-êqueuing or de-êqueuing. Or, at leastde-êqueuing for depending on do you have a left-êturner at thehead of your queue and do your lights stay left
Assumption;And it also corresponds to time
Assumption;And that becomes a little more complicated right,once you have more roads
Assumption;And the logic here is that maybe the cop figure is thisGod-êlike thing that creates cars and queues them too andthat would go
Assumption;And then depending on 3what type of car, you queue it up on the lane.
Assumption;and then it's really the cop to say, okay 
Assumption;And then that dictates, so it's like--suppose we have a horizontal, horizontal versus vertical andit says the intersection is traveling horizontally now, tick ticktick boom it's traveling vertically now
Assumption;And then we need an F. a frequency value for theroad
Assumption;And thennetwork was responsible for pairing up those intersections.
Assumption;Andthis intersection says basically as we're determining whetherto pop, we have to ask this intersection is it okay to, if there'san intersection here is it okay to push on there before wepop here.
Assumption;Because the popping logic, you can't pop ifthe other road is full
Assumption;been saying that's just the default, wehaven't talked about specific types of observation.
Assumption;beginner phase of the model, right, andinto the receiver, or we could even have it take on a model,right.
Assumption;Beginning a queue on yellow lights. So more logic in thestates
Assumption;car lengths and queue has amaximum of n. And then as we're bumping the value ofdistance travelled, it needs to be sensitive to who's in frontof it. You can never exceed distance traveled of the personin front of you in the queue.
Assumption;cars into this road can come from here goingstraight, here turning left, or here turning right.
Assumption;create a road there's no intersection, so road existsoutside of the intersection
Assumption;Did we have a constraint of only four roads per intersection?
Assumption;Directional -- okay. I'm thinking this is a queue, this is aqueue, this a queue.
Assumption;evaluation should be, should we say areable to evaluate per intersection or per
Assumption;feel like the rate at which the cars are 
Assumption;For that guy comingon this onramp, how does he get through the sim whetherhe can make straight road, you know straight-êthru's, you goleft and/or right or maybe a frequency, some distribution.So mostly straight and sometimes right.
Assumption;Have some tick then sendssome then sends tick event to model.
Assumption;Head of road. Road. Head of RSAper road. And if that, if the car equals straight
Assumption;If it's a single lane of traffic, could those left-êturners andstraight-êthrough-êers be queued up in the same queue
Assumption;If the car at thehead of, well the entrance. I guess
Assumption;if this is ourcanvass and that's an onramp and that's an off ramp, youhave a special edge intersection
Assumption;if we make the capacity of the geometry and youcould sort of simulate a highway or something
Assumption;if you gothrough that's fine and then through that's fine.
Assumption;If you have multiple lanesthen you could say the left one is always turning left
Assumption;if you're thinking graphically, if this iscapacity and wait time, the capacity is going to be graphedsomething like that
Assumption;if you're visiting anintersection and a road you don't have to be those thingsthere, all that logic is pretty 
Assumption;It depends if there's two lanes or not.
Assumption;it has a tick and the tick method really then says I thinkwe're going to time this happened, I'm going to go check my[inaudible] and I'm going to kick off, so its like we're sayingthat this is a traverser.
Assumption;It would have multiple lanes so thatin a sense it has multiple queues
Assumption;It's a simplifying assumption
Assumption;It's almost as if when we--basically per tick we haveto go through each intersection in some defined order too,
Assumption;it's almost like you just step up a level and have anobject called a network and that's the thing that assemblesintersection out of roads and knows whether its an exteriorroad or an interior road and all that
Assumption;it's an interior road if anotherroad--because this says you're going in here and out here sois this--is an interior road just one queue or in general 
Assumption;it'sreally a function of the result of how the intersections arelaid out. And the relationship between the intersection. 8
Assumption;Let's say I'm not interested in all the roadsof an intersection, just that particular road
Assumption;let's supposeto you do here to here onramp, off ramp. And so this pointnow we can get an interior, now we've got an interior.
Assumption;light, it'sreally almost green, then we have r.pop, 
Assumption;maybe that's sort of an object-êoriented way. The roadkeeps up its own cars in the sense that
Assumption;Maybe this is this card, this push notion right now and just ahand wave and have it happening in a global sense
Assumption;Maybe we randomize the--at a pop and push. Wealso then randomize the actual direction of the car.
Assumption;My first inclination is to say, okay the rules if rules can getpushed into the objects and then tick maybe into the--distribute the rules into the network and then at every tickeach aspect, each car gets a tick, each intersection gets atick, each road gets a tick.
Assumption;okay so this is road,and so it has a queue, and an abstraction with a push, pop
Assumption;Once again, it's per tick right
Assumption;One car per tic.
Assumption;One car per tick passes if ahead of 4the--I guess there's a couple cases 
Assumption;Only for the onramp roads
Assumption;or left versusstraight in our case
Assumption;Or, wait. Well that's [inaudible] one cargoes per tick.
Assumption;Say some number of cars per minute while the lights green.
Assumption;Should we define an initial simple intersection, an initialsimple car
Assumption;similar to we had analytic data on intersections. Imean, its kind of an annotation network
Assumption;so clock is a controller
Assumption;So for every tick, the analytics guy does asweep, collecting statistical data about the state of each tick
Assumption;So I want to start and observe a simulation.
Assumption;so intersection then we need car, we need the notionof time, this is a simulation of time
Assumption;So length, in some ways, for ourpurposes, is just the number of cars that it will hold
Assumption;so let's suppose T onerepresent a delta of say four units in time, so four clock ticks,and we say one car per clock tick can pass or something
Assumption;So maybe a drawing of a, the simplest intersection, right, andan intersection, and have a particular road would have -ê it'sdirectional on either side, right. There are some number ofcars flowing on a particular road waiting at an intersection.There is a clock, right, that governs when the lights change.So, there are lights, right. This goes across the street rightthere.
Assumption;so some sort of analytic data gets collected onunder a car per cycle through.
Assumption;So that means car, cuz that's green, car and the, so how dowe 
Assumption;So the frequency F here is not a global to the network, it's asetting on a particular onramp road.
Assumption;So the intersectionhas light gating a pair of roads, light gating another pair ofroads. There's the light, I guess per pair of roads.
Assumption;So then, so suppose, so we're going to have thecars done in one tic right.
Assumption;So this guy goes away.4
Assumption;so this is like the network and the network has, maintainsthis graph of nodes and edges. Where a node is anintersection and an edge is a road but we now have overcomplicated things 
Assumption;so this random number generator affectsnew--the next direction of the cars that come in from theoutside
Assumption;So thisall, is this all cop
Assumption;So we could justarbitrarily define that it takes two seconds off the wait timeor something
Assumption;So we have to have some sort of timer model that 
Assumption;So wecould introduce a notion of speed into our queue
Assumption;so what I'm thinking is maybe there's arandom number generator here that has two inputs of likebasically the probability, right
Assumption;So what we're saying isthere's a distinction--what you're saying is there's adistinction between an interior road and then the places thatthe random--the places that the random number generatorfeeds them in.
Assumption;So zero to one, which is afrequency number
Assumption;So, let's suppose we start with, say this picture is T zero.What would, okay so they can't, let's suppose for a momentthat T zero has all the lights about to change, so in the sensethat wherever I just point in time nothing's moving and we'reshowing x point in time where something has moved sort ofbefore and after state.
Assumption;Some number of roads, be it in, out, horizontal andin, out vertical. 
Assumption;Somehow we need to represent the amount of trafficor traffic flow
Assumption;Sothe driver's been in this car for ten minutes going nowhere.
Assumption;speed of the car
Assumption;start with a model and start with the simplestmodel to get the simplest intersection flowing with cars andtiming.
Assumption;Suppose you have even a simulationobject, it has a clock and a network and here's the clock andit tells the clock time
Assumption;That kicks off events and then which then make a [inaudible
Assumption;That kicks off events.
Assumption;that's an interesting question, how do we traverse thegraph
Assumption;That's another thing is lanes, right? Lanes...
Assumption;That's theonly way you could pop in the at case, right?
Assumption;thatthe road has some number of, an 
Assumption;the average wait time for an averagecar going through our city streets
Assumption;The edge, there can only be two edges betweenintersections and they're oriented oppositely, you can't havetwo intersections going out
Assumption;the lane would be an addition of the road with somespecific logic data.
Assumption;The random number generator could try to pump a new carin 
Assumption;The sim right, it's almost like, I like cop. Let's just say copwith that controls the light too.
Assumption;then depending on therandom number generator, each tick is random whether youpush a car or not
Assumption;then does that mean like onthe intersection then, so you've got an intersection objectwhich basically has four pointers to other intersection,possible intersections
Assumption;then you can only move maybe the actual road, like youcan't move the intersection
Assumption;then you increment the distance traveled from front toback of the queue
Assumption;thepopping might be a little complicated as you start buildingthese next to each other.
Assumption;There might be an implicitstep in the network to say to keep the network modelconstraints by introducing an intersection if it needs to at ajunction
Assumption;There's a, you can copy left-êhand turns protected bygreen arrow lights 
Assumption;there's no pop after a certain number of ticks orsomething like that on any given road
Assumption;this intersection into thisqueue it goes in here and the next tick, as long as there areno cars in front of it, it will go maybe two spaces orsomething. Okay. So there's a notion of just a regular queueand there's a notion of slots in a queue
Assumption;This is a queue and what we're reallyinterested in is how those cars queue up, how big the queuesget, when the queues release and how many we can pop-êupthe end of the queue for some given clock tick. Then we cankeep speed constant for 
Assumption;this road is geometrically shorter, then thisessentially is saying all roads are the same length
Assumption;tick if, let's say for each road in the simulation
Assumption;Traffic light sensors, traffic light timing,
Assumption;Two queues: one going straight, one going left.
Assumption;want the wait time to go flat with increasingcapacity.
Assumption;We could do it that way. Either that or we could make roadsdominant and then intersections really just a thing thathappens at road crossings.
Assumption;We have some constraints on the flow of the queuesbecause we can't have lights coming in a collision course.
Assumption;We need something that represents intersections.
Assumption;well in our world there's always atleast two lanes and the left lane is always the left laneturning. For this situation
Assumption;Well then wouldn't that be then still have two types of carbut
Assumption;wepegged the random number generators to be flowing at acertain grade. 
Assumption;We're prettyconstrained in what we draw geometrically so it almostseems like it might be nice to [inaudible] the geometry fromthe simulation
Assumption;we're saying that's kind of likethe network, or the graph traverse all. So, network cop goesthrough a grid or logic has to traverse this thing in a way thatpeople could use it.
Assumption;we've said that roads are basically queue's sowhat 
Assumption;When it went through, it would pop to the front ofthe queue in the next intersection
Assumption;would that be a property of the car onthe current wait time or something like that
Assumption;Yeah, yeah just need, well one probably also needs an admin 
Assumption;you couldhave like a, well we have for interior road we have amaximum number of slots, 
Assumption;You have basically, I'dimagine, you start with a blank slate
Assumption;You'd have to say well, theroad on the opposite side has no cars, or we're just about toturn red.
Assumption;You're not going to have cars just popping up on the endhere. Unless you're the terminator and you've beamed acar.
Assumption;you're trying to do the yield, you know trying tosimulate the yield rule, right
Behavioural Decision; is the car when itgets in queue, picks up this n value saying that's the size ofthe road and each tick it can increment one
Behavioural Decision; the light's behaviorshould be able to change based upon the input of thesensors. 
Behavioural Decision;A road is how many--what's yourcapacity and how full are you on average. Kind of metricswe've collected.
Behavioural Decision;also like how longthese signals stay green
Behavioural Decision;And so the copsays okay, I try to tick, the intersections says I'm still or thatlight says I'm still green, and let's suppose this guy has rulessaying every four ticks change the colors of the lights.
Behavioural Decision;And so, should we say the initial state would be this lightsgreen and this lights green.
Behavioural Decision;And that's dictatingstate of the lights, 
Behavioural Decision;And they have certain states, we've said.
Behavioural Decision;At each tick, based on the constraints of who's infront of you. The guy can speed along the road until he getsbehind some slow poke.
Behavioural Decision;Because we--we explicitly disallow all the lights at an3intersection to be green for the sensor
Behavioural Decision;Determining when to push and pop.
Behavioural Decision;Do we flip the state of the lightsdifferently based on the state of the sensor
Behavioural Decision;he makes a left and slow-êpoke goes straight orsomething. And he can speed up again.
Behavioural Decision;I mean the light is just anactual state. Which can mean green light, red or yellow
Behavioural Decision;If that state is this, then the otherstates are going to be
Behavioural Decision;if this road fills up, then even if this is green,this car won't be able to pass
Behavioural Decision;if we want to get more sophisticated wecould have sensor logic taking sensor for each in-êroad so thatif say these two are empty then these two just stay greenforever
Behavioural Decision;Is that also something the cop looksat?
Behavioural Decision;it's, the cop is looking at well state of thesignal and the some, probably also needs to define some sortof great [inaudible] cuz that's something that user should beable to control rate of the traffic. How heavy the traffic is 
Behavioural Decision;it'sanalytic data saying okay you're still in this queue.
Behavioural Decision;now I'm wondering like the rule for changing the lights,we established a rule saying the light, are we going to saylight would change to green, or will only stay red for xamount of time, or is it reversed
Behavioural Decision;on each tick, not only does the push popbut also changes the car's straight left and right, 
Behavioural Decision;see the state ofthe light at that particular time, and then make somedecision to cop or--so does it seem like there's a masterintelligence that needs to be looking at the whole state ofthe world.
Behavioural Decision;Seems like it's just the state of, well this is--
Behavioural Decision;sensor say subtracts four ticks, say subtracts fourticks from the threshold number of ticks to do a change so.That yellow light logic is preferably more than what itsasking.
Behavioural Decision;so clock is a controller. Have some tick then sendssome then sends tick event to model.
Behavioural Decision;So it's almost like orange guy and we're saying there, andthen the picture changes to where that goes to one and thatgoes to one, that stays at zero, and that stays at zero
Behavioural Decision;So it's saying at each tick we see where the problems occurand maybe make a road blink red if it's full and
Behavioural Decision;so let's suppose T onerepresent a delta of say four units in time, so four clock ticks,and we say one car per clock tick can pass or something.
Behavioural Decision;so somehow represents the state of each trafficsignals.
Behavioural Decision;so the cop looks at the intersections says okay it's agreen light on these roads. This road has some number ofcars in it. If the lights green one tick means we pop and wedo that queue and second picture. So, from T zero to T onethat's how we've gone through two
Behavioural Decision;so the cop, yeah, per tick at this point the cop justchanges the state of the model consistently.
Behavioural Decision;so the pop is controlled by, we said by thecop in the intersection
Behavioural Decision;so tick happens and changes time, cop is watchingtime, for each tick cop has some set of rules that it knowsand based on those rules changes the queue of cars, wellmaybe those rules are really what's going on in theintersection and, you know, how fast the car is traveling say,but then there's also the notion of state of traffic so, youknow, what is that a road, some number of roads that have,and just wonder if maybe the important thing is since we aretrying to simulate traffic, traffic happens, so this road is kindof like queue, queue is the road say cuz that's what weretrying to determine is, trying to minimize the average size ofthe queue by optimizing the timing on the lights. So, theroad has a queue, blue boxes on the road and that's a[inaudible] structure
Behavioural Decision;So we're on a tick so we're checking theheads of each of the queues against the lights, type of car inthe queue
Behavioural Decision;So, an event happens, some event is given to a, well thismodel cop -
Behavioural Decision;That's part of the rule. There's certain rules, the rulesencapsulate maybe the length of the time that the light,maybe the rate at which the cars come,
Behavioural Decision;the green to red light change is, we have light so somemaster controller, kind of like a cop
Behavioural Decision;then this guy would have a state. It's like okay I'vebeen in this state for two ticks, go to three don't change, goto four change, something like that. Right, so this guy has anotion of the state of the light but also time and currentstate, right. So, the clock ticks, the cop says look at whatlights are green, one tick means one car goes through so wepop off the end of the queue, we say the cop notices the endof the intersection has been in this state for one tick so nochange needs to be made. And then we get the same greenstate
Behavioural Decision;then we're saying that the behavior here, even if it'sstaying green depends on the state of this queue here. Andthere's a notion of full.
Behavioural Decision;Until he passes the intersection, or whatever. And gets onthe next road
Behavioural Decision;we're changing the lightsevery two ticks, right. So that will be a scenario where, okayone tick so from two to one, we go to zero and now thelights change for the initial state of T2. That would be this
Behavioural Decision;we're saying there's a, so then, these are objects right.So, maybe what happens is the clock is the controller, it'schanging the state of time so time can tick, right, that's anamount of time. The clock does the ticking, right, and nowthe tick, time is part of model that is state, but as timechanges some cop object or something responds to timechanges, right, and is responsible for changing state ofmodel.
Behavioural Decision;What I'm thinking is like you have this data structure of thistraffic cop that responds to ticks by analyzing the state of thetraffic signal and then, you know, pushes cars on and offqueue depending on the -ê
Behavioural Decision;What would, okay so they can't, let's suppose for a momentthat T zero has all the lights about to change, so in the sensethat wherever I just point in time nothing's moving and we'reshowing x point in time where something has moved sort ofbefore and after state.
Behavioural Decision;Whether there's asensor and we'll--how may seconds for each light change
Behavioural Decision;you have an intersection visitor and it's responsible forcertain things
Clarification;Does that saygreen, red, and left?
Clarification;Does the network also split up the roads
Clarification;how do Icreate an intersection
Clarification;is itthe same thing?
Clarification;Where does that say off ramp?
Clarification;Would that be a property of the queue or a property of thecar?
Clarification;You mean the actual data structures?
Coordinate Group Process; Okay so it says that's up to us
Coordinate Group Process;And nowshould we try 
Coordinate Group Process;And then come up with progressively--start off with thesimplest user story, and then progressively add user stories3and then maybe have pictures to illustrate how in our systemthose user stories will be achieved
Coordinate Group Process;At least we can go through it right now. A few tables
Coordinate Group Process;fifteen minutes into documenting,talking about the engineering design, code structure
Coordinate Group Process;I guess we should write some of these things down.
Coordinate Group Process;I was thinking we could startwith what we have now and fall on a user story of runningthis simulation now. 
Coordinate Group Process;I'm sort of reminded of the fact that we're supposed to allowlights to have sets of rules
Coordinate Group Process;I'm wondering with half an hour left if we need to thinkabout how to--
Coordinate Group Process;Let's sketch a UI
Coordinate Group Process;maybe we can peg that for the moment and introducethat as we flush this out.
Coordinate Group Process;Maybe we should start talking about the U
Coordinate Group Process;Should we start soon?
Coordinate Group Process;So basic--design a basic structure of code.So to me, that's where we've got the model. The model anda little bit of how controller controls the model.
Coordinate Group Process;So should we talk about end [inaudible
Coordinate Group Process;well let's stick to the grid
Coordinate Group Process;Well now, intersection class
Coordinate Group Process;We'll tackle that when we get there
Coordinate Group Process;well we can write that down
Coordinate Group Process;where's the first place to start?
Coordinate Group Process;yeah maybe let's start with thenetwork
Data Decision;what basic data structures are we looking at here?
Design Principle;But I imagine the controller controls that, right, the modelbasically is just the basically cars, the queue of cars, theintersection contains four queues.
Design Principle;I'm thinking, yeah, I'm thinking in terms of model-êviewcontroller
Design Principle;mean it might be thedesign pattern. A traverser, observer, traverser
Design Principle;object being traversed and somerule for--so it's easy the traverser, visitor pattern you get thevisitor case on the auto-êtype and then it could be [inaudible
Doubt; I don't know 
Doubt; I don't know how to actually structure this
Doubt; wonder if atfirst approximation never [inaudible] in roads. 
Doubt;And I wonder
Doubt;I don't know
Doubt;I don't know if this isany better
Doubt;I mean I'm wondering could youadd
Doubt;I wonder if 
Doubt;I'm notquite sure 
Doubt;just wonder if maybe the important 
Doubt;Well, I don't know
Elaborate;And the results of pushing and popping.
Elaborate;And then some T, at some point T one later.
Elaborate;I mean you could go top left
Elaborate;so the cop looks at the intersections says okay it's agreen light on these roads. This road has some number ofcars in it. If the lights green one tick means we pop and wedo that queue and second picture. So, from T zero to T onethat's how we've gone through two
Elaborate;That kicks off events and then which then make a [inaudible
Elaborate;That kicks off events.
Elaborate;The other way
Elaborate;This guywould have the sensor state, 
Elaborate;Unless you're the terminator and you've beamed acar.
Elaborate;Until he passes the intersection, or whatever. And gets onthe next road
Elaborate;we're saying there's a, so then, these are objects right.So, maybe what happens is the clock is the controller, it'schanging the state of time so time can tick, right, that's anamount of time. The clock does the ticking, right, and nowthe tick, time is part of model that is state, but as timechanges some cop object or something responds to timechanges, right, and is responsible for changing state ofmodel.
Elaboration;Are they controlling 
Elaboration;so they can build on?
Elaboration;something?
Encourage;Well I like what you're saying, I like the idea
Explain and Clarify;As capacity increases, the wait time doesn't increaseproportionally
Explain and Clarify;It'sreally just a list of road, road pairs I guess, and thenintersections
Explain and Clarify;then this way wecan, it's really the network that runs the road, 
Explain and Clarify;What I'm thinking is like you have this data structure of thistraffic cop that responds to ticks by analyzing the state of thetraffic signal and then, you know, pushes cars on and offqueue depending on the -ê
Functionality; I wanted toessentially run a simulation for two minutes and thenevaluate the system's success
Functionality;And then the next thingyou could do, well you create an onramp, drag it through andnow it's an off ramp and an intersection pops up
Functionality;Andthat controls the frequency and 
Functionality;it kind of shows you how many cars
Functionality;Okay so that'ssaying that we can, if it's an onramp road we need to be ableto select it and change the frequency coming out of thatroad on an individual basis and hold the frequency for allentry ways
Functionality;Okay soc.run(n) initiates the clock, and it's just pumping ticks at thenetwork. And then the network really is just a collection ofinstances of these kinds of things as the user creates themon their own.
Functionality;okaywell cars are coming in, have this property. Like, fiftypercent will want to
Functionality;simulation program maybe wewont allow the [inaudible].
Functionality;So as you drag, as you drageach intersection on it will snap and say okay I'm connectedto here and to here, and it snaps. 
Functionality;So I'll use a soliddot to mean ownership and then an open dot to meanreferencing. So the network owns the roads, the networkowns the intersections but the intersection can referencethese in and out roads. Alright, so I guess we need, addroad
Functionality;That's introducing to some new road, some newparameters. And then I think that in some ways add, wellthere's definitely add intersection. And that has some set ofparameters. 
Functionality;this could be contact sensitive, right soyou click on an intersection and it shows you average waittime.
Functionality;Using geometric, special arrangement to indicate capacity, soit all makes sense.
Functionality;Where roads geometrically cross andautomatically put an intersection there
Illustration;And ithas a queue, which of course has push [inaudible]. Okay.
Illustration;It has sensors and, it has the timing, current state, no it hasticks in current state
Implementation Decision;n = new network,, c = new clock. Andthen we go c.run(n). 
Implementation Decision;so maybe this is public and this is private in the sensethat you only ever have roads in the network when it's at theintersections because I don't think, I'm trying to
Infer; Okay so it says that's up to us
Infer; so dowe want to have visualization of cars moving along aparticular road in a geometric sense? 
Infer; so now the push is not just the random numbergenerator for frequency, but there's also random numbergenerator for zero one for left versus right
Infer;. So add road could potentially have, what's theplace you could ever, you did this.
Infer;but should readily accommodate six intersections--okayso we can actually accommodate [inaudible] larger
Infer;create a road there's no intersection, so road existsoutside of the intersection
Infer;It would have multiple lanes so thatin a sense it has multiple queues
Infer;Like so that you've got this intersection next to thisintersection and if this road fills up, then even 
Infer;Right so this is now a UI piece and the dot, brings up youreditor with frequency of, your frequency value
Infer;so
Infer;So all these lines of 
Infer;so clock is a controller
Infer;So do you want 
Infer;So for every tick, the analytics guy does asweep, collecting statistical data about the state of each tick
Infer;So foreach road in the simulation we look at the car at the head ofthe queue
Infer;so get rid of this 
Infer;So highlight 
Infer;So I 
Infer;so I can see traffic flow across it.
Infer;So I think that might bethe best way to communicate interaction design.
Infer;So I think that's 
Infer;So I was thinking 
Infer;So if the 
Infer;So I'll use a soliddot to mean ownership and then an open dot to meanreferencing. So the network owns the roads, the networkowns the intersections but the intersection can referencethese in and out roads. Alright, so I guess we need, addroad
Infer;So I'm thinking maybe
Infer;so instead of just a straight 
Infer;so is there someone looking at the networksaying the average congestion is, or the average wait time ofa car is,
Infer;So it might be thatthe road has some number of, an ordered list of cars that aremoving along the road and only when they get to the end ofthe road do they get pushed into the queue. 
Infer;So it should 
Infer;So it's a visit
Infer;So it's got to be just a grid likethat. That's fine.
Infer;So it's like8you're inferring intersection at crossings.
Infer;So it's saying at each tick we see where the problems occurand maybe make a road blink red if it's full and
Infer;So I've got two car lengths 
Infer;So let's 
Infer;so max cars, holds n.1
Infer;So maybe 
Infer;So maybe it'sreally a function of the result of how the intersections arelaid out. And the relationship between the intersection. 8
Infer;so maybe this is public and this is private in the sensethat you only ever have roads in the network when it's at theintersections because I don't think, I'm trying to
Infer;so maybe we 
Infer;So mostly straight and sometimes 
Infer;so next userstory 
Infer;so that comes back toanalytics right?
Infer;So that kind of comes into car
Infer;so that thisintersection is connected to this one, or is that
Infer;So that would 
Infer;So that you 
Infer;So that's just the function or the property on thelight
Infer;so that's one thing, and also like how longthese signals stay green
Infer;So that's the basic way to kick it all off I guess
Infer;so the cop as, 
Infer;So the empty network is what we started outwith a blank page, as they drag a road on, that instantiates aroad object
Infer;So the only other way youcan get through
Infer;so the pop 
Infer;So the random number 
Infer;So then you drag 
Infer;So therandom 
Infer;so there needs to be some logic about, wellthat's interesting so there's a notion of the road in, road out.
Infer;So there's through here, off ramp and onramp right
Infer;So this is interesting, so now should allow for roads of anylength to be placed
Infer;So this network or graph hasadditional constraints.
Infer;So this one piece of state we haven't captured is whether aroad is an interior or we should call it an onramp
Infer;So this whole thing we should talk about road, got this modelcontrol or 
Infer;So we 
Infer;So we almost don't need a--well, we need car to havesomething in the queue
Infer;so we could come 
Infer;So we makeroads, right. So one m of intersections and we would haveroad connected to the intersection or the intersection has2paths
Infer;so we need to communicate the interaction
Infer;So we want to, you know, does thishappen basically.
Infer;So wecould introduce a notion of speed into our queue
Infer;so we're 
Infer;So we're getting some credit collection of rules here
Infer;so we've created a basic [inaudible] for it to run in.
Infer;So we've got a great 
Infer;So when it comes 
Infer;So where you 
Infer;So you can't 
Infer;so you click an 
Infer;so you have a consistent road network.
Infer;So you have to explain
Infer;so you want the 
Infer;So youcould simplify 
Infer;So you're 
Infer;So you're just doing it 
Infer;So, go ahead
Infer;So, something happens as an external controller is ticking themodel
Infer;Sodoes it have a sensor, yes, no
Infer;Sothat we 
Infer;sothis can be bigger than the window so scrolling, stuff likethat
Infer;then this guy would have a state. It's like okay I'vebeen in this state for two ticks, go to three don't change, goto four change, something like that. Right, so this guy has anotion of the state of the light but also time and currentstate, right. So, the clock ticks, the cop says look at whatlights are green, one tick means one car goes through so wepop off the end of the queue, we say the cop notices the endof the intersection has been in this state for one tick so nochange needs to be made. And then we get the same greenstate
Infer;We're prettyconstrained in what we draw geometrically so it almostseems like it might be nice to [inaudible] the geometry fromthe simulation
Inform; I guess I should put wait time here, capacity here.
Inform; it should bepossible to create a busy road or a seldom used one, or any 0variation in between.
Inform; So that'scase one, that's case one. Case two would be we've got aleft-êhand turn and we're either yellow or
Inform; the cop is looking at well state of thesignal and the some
Inform;, that's the complication that arises when you allowthat, is you have to figure out how it's--
Inform;. A cop is kind of controlling the state of the model
Inform;also don't need to push on herebecause the--this, you don't need to randomly push on herebecause all the cars coming in this queue are going to becoming from this road. Either from here, or from there.
Inform;Also maybe analyze the load on an intersection for road, fora particular road
Inform;although I mean theoretically you could do somethinglike this 
Inform;And as well as the signal.
Inform;And it also corresponds to time
Inform;And so the copsays okay, I try to tick, the intersections says I'm still or thatlight says I'm still green, and let's suppose this guy has rulessaying every four ticks change the colors of the lights.
Inform;And so, should we say the initial state would be this lightsgreen and this lights green.
Inform;And that also maybe also [inaudible] as the right hand turn
Inform;And the fact that we can't have a T-êjunction keeps us fromdoing things like that, right
Inform;And the results of pushing and popping.
Inform;And then depending on 3what type of car, you queue it up on the lane.
Inform;And then some T, at some point T one later.
Inform;As capacity increases, the wait time doesn't increaseproportionally
Inform;Because cars into this road can come from here goingstraight, here turning left, or here turning right
Inform;because each road can have adifferent rate.
Inform;because I think observegets into the analytics
Inform;because I think one of the goals here is tocommunicate this to
Inform;Because I'm having trouble 
Inform;Because I'm thinking
Inform;because it can't turn ifthe road in the opposite has cars in it.
Inform;Because it kind of applies
Inform;because it's the cop that's receiving the tick, right?
Inform;Because let'ssuppose we make it so every 
Inform;Because now as you drag thisone over you've got to make sure to drag that one over
Inform;because roads kind of come in pairs as faras we're concerned
Inform;Because that might be avariable way of entering
Inform;because that then really shows the success of the networkoverall
Inform;because that's a way tothen, you know that's a way to sort 
Inform;Because that'sthe queue for the light.
Inform;Because the popping logic, you can't pop ifthe other road is full
Inform;Because the simulation is supposed to be not just one
Inform;because thenwho's responsible for coordinating. 
Inform;Because they've got to be
Inform;because we have directional graph andwe have [inaudible] and dopplets of what's a valid graph
Inform;Because we're not supposed to have T-êjunctionswe're supposed to have...
Inform;Because you could also, Imean, theoretically you could also have an intersectionwhere this goes left and straight and this is just red.
Inform;because your'e talking abouta kind of combination of a rule and an action,
Inform;Because, forinstance if this 
Inform;because--so anyway we go through the intersection
Inform;because--this would be interesting things tosimulate.
Inform;But I think that would become a bit spaghetti 
Inform;Controls
Inform;Crossing roads
Inform;cuz that's something 
Inform;Directional -- okay. I'm thinking this is a queue, this is aqueue, this a queue.
Inform;evaluation should be, should we say areable to evaluate per intersection or per
Inform;here, maybe we should do it a little moreformally
Inform;I guess aspects of parameters of the simulation, really
Inform;I guess in our view that's not always true
Inform;I guess the only last thing isthere are cars that are created by the--cars that are createdessentially by the cop and introduced into onramp roads.And they have certain states, we've said.
Inform;I guess the other thing that would be--the other big piecehere is analytics,
Inform;I mean you could go top left
Inform;I meant connecting intersections
Inform;I think we canassume we have a video camera rolling and we can gothrough the other scenarios
Inform;I want to evaluate success of each simulation.
Inform;I'm thinking that would be implicit inthe sense that I drag a road vertical, and I drag a roadhorizontal and the geometric--
Inform;I'm thinking, yeah, I'm thinking in terms of model-êviewcontroller
Inform;I'm wondering with half an hour left if we need to thinkabout how to--
Inform;inaudible] has a type for A
Inform;It might not even matter so much in that
Inform;it seems like maybe, because then you have to then it'sseparate then you have to do them in sync. So maybe it'sreally a function of the result of how the intersections arelaid out. And the relationship between the intersection
Inform;it sort of seems like it is appropriate because a copneeds to look at the top of the queue, or needs to look at thetop of the queue to see what kind of car it is
Inform;it's almost like you just step up a level and have anobject called a network and that's the thing that assemblesintersection out of roads and knows whether its an exteriorroad or an interior road and all that
Inform;It's almost like you need to traffic cop, right, traffic copcontroller
Inform;it's an interior road if anotherroad--because this says you're going in here and out here sois this--is an interior road just one queue or in general 
Inform;It's coming together though, I think. It's just more rules.
Inform;It's going
Inform;It's like there's a network kind of as well saying, okaywell we--I have, this line here says for each road in thesimulation do something. 
Inform;it's not going to work. That's
Inform;It's really a geometric property of the road
Inform;It's sayinghow far along are you in your road
Inform;It'sreally just a list of road, road pairs I guess, and thenintersections
Inform;Maybe this is this card, this push notion right now and just ahand wave and have it happening in a global sense
Inform;Maybe we randomize the--at a pop and push. Wealso then randomize the actual direction of the car.
Inform;My first inclination is to say, okay the rules if rules can getpushed into the objects and then tick maybe into the--distribute the rules into the network and then at every tickeach aspect, each car gets a tick, each intersection gets atick, each road gets a tick.
Inform;My initial thinking was you'd have intersection object thatcontained four roads they're all incoming roads
Inform;Now left-êturn is a little more special 
Inform;now we're looking at this visually is thisnotion of speed of the car through a particular road
Inform;Oh right, like a traffic jam
Inform;One car per tic.
Inform;One thing we could simplify is, in order to get--because thismatters
Inform;One thing we could simplify is, in order to get--because thismatters
Inform;Say some number of cars per minute while the lights green.
Inform;Say start with a model and start with the simplestmodel to get the simplest intersection flowing with cars andtiming
Inform;So I guess then [inaudible] is no pop
Inform;so intersection then we need car, we need the notionof time, this is a simulation of time
Inform;So maybe a drawing of a, the simplest intersection, right, andan intersection, and have a particular road would have -ê it'sdirectional on either side, right. There are some number ofcars flowing on a particular road waiting at an intersection.There is a clock, right, that governs when the lights change.So, there are lights, right. This goes across the street rightthere.
Inform;so maybe we should run through some,you know, how pictures will change from one moment oftime to another and think about how the software wouldcreate those pictures maybe.
Inform;So our onramp, offramp
Inform;so the cop looks at the intersections says okay it's agreen light on these roads. This road has some number ofcars in it. If the lights green one tick means we pop and wedo that queue and second picture. So, from T zero to T onethat's how we've gone through two
Inform;So the frequency F here is not a global to the network, it's asetting on a particular onramp road.
Inform;So two things: design and interaction
Inform;So we have to have some sort of timer model that 
Inform;so what I'm thinking is maybe there's arandom number generator here that has two inputs of likebasically the probability, right
Inform;So, let's say delta one tic maybe or something
Inform;So, one thing wehaven't talked about is how we in queue a car.
Inform;So, yeah I guess at a very base level we kick everything offwith main( ). Right
Inform;Somehow we need to represent the amount of trafficor traffic flow
Inform;Speed of simulation
Inform;speed of the car
Inform;Start, observe, and then we'll put pause
Inform;That kicks off events and then which then make a [inaudible
Inform;That kicks off events.
Inform;That's another thing is thelight
Inform;The classjust gets huge and you end up [inaudible] it. But yeah, I likethe [inaudible
Inform;the cop, let's do--so it has sort of rules
Inform;the lane would be an addition of the road with somespecific logic data.
Inform;The next direction of the car.
Inform;The other way
Inform;then this way wecan, it's really the network that runs the road, 
Inform;Then what we're really trying to do isminimize the wait time
Inform;therandom number generator could saturate the space on theroads.
Inform;there's rules governing if you have two carsgoing into the same road, which goes first per tick, 
Inform;This guywould have the sensor state, 
Inform;This is a queue and what we're reallyinterested in is how those cars queue up, how big the queuesget, when the queues release and how many we can pop-êupthe end of the queue for some given clock tick. Then we cankeep speed constant for 
Inform;This is starting to sound very--I mean I can already see thelength of the source file for the car
Inform;those are randomly generated, and maybe thetype of car has a random output
Inform;Traverser of network
Inform;Two queues.
Inform;Unless you're the terminator and you've beamed acar.
Inform;Until he passes the intersection, or whatever. And gets onthe next road
Inform;We could make this pretty simple
Inform;We have some constraints on the flow of the queuesbecause we can't have lights coming in a collision course.
Inform;We need something that represents intersections.
Inform;we should talk about road, got this modelcontrol 
Inform;Well capacity is a good one to have because then you canevaluate wait time per
Inform;Well it seems like a lot of the logic is going to be--a lot of thecomplication is going to be in the push and pop actions
Inform;we're saying there's a, so then, these are objects right.So, maybe what happens is the clock is the controller, it'schanging the state of time so time can tick, right, that's anamount of time. The clock does the ticking, right, and nowthe tick, time is part of model that is state, but as timechanges some cop object or something responds to timechanges, right, and is responsible for changing state ofmodel.
Inform;What I'm thinking is like you have this data structure of thistraffic cop that responds to ticks by analyzing the state of thetraffic signal and then, you know, pushes cars on and offqueue depending on the -ê
Inform;Where it could be going. And theseare basically, these better be pointing
Inform;where you put these roads determines how the queue,the maximum number of cars in an intersection
Inform;whether it has a sensor, and maybe some logic around--sortof setting in the rules we need some sort of rule editor 
Inform;would that be a property of the car onthe current wait time or something like that
Inform;yeah maybe let's start with thenetwork
Inform;Yeah we could make it all horizontal and vertical roads soyou start on, off, on, off, intersection, 
Inform;you can't pick up thisintersection, it would make sense to move the entire road
Information; howcongested is it? 
Information;And that would be what?
Information;so what basic data structures are we looking at here?
Information;What elsedo we have
Information;what would this guy have? 
Justify;. A cop is kind of controlling the state of the model
Justify;also don't need to push on herebecause the--this, you don't need to randomly push on herebecause all the cars coming in this queue are going to becoming from this road. Either from here, or from there.
Justify;although I mean theoretically you could do somethinglike this 
Justify;Because cars into this road can come from here goingstraight, here turning left, or here turning right
Justify;because each road can have adifferent rate.
Justify;because I think one of the goals here is tocommunicate this to
Justify;Because I'm having trouble 
Justify;Because I'm thinking
Justify;because it can't turn ifthe road in the opposite has cars in it.
Justify;Because it kind of applies
Justify;because it's the cop that's receiving the tick, right?
Justify;Because let'ssuppose we make it so every 
Justify;Because now as you drag thisone over you've got to make sure to drag that one over
Justify;because roads kind of come in pairs as faras we're concerned
Justify;Because that might be avariable way of entering
Justify;because that then really shows the success of the networkoverall
Justify;because that's a way tothen, you know that's a way to sort 
Justify;Because that'sthe queue for the light.
Justify;Because the popping logic, you can't pop ifthe other road is full
Justify;Because the simulation is supposed to be not just one
Justify;because thenwho's responsible for coordinating. 
Justify;Because they've got to be
Justify;because we have directional graph andwe have [inaudible] and dopplets of what's a valid graph
Justify;Because we're not supposed to have T-êjunctionswe're supposed to have...
Justify;Because you could also, Imean, theoretically you could also have an intersectionwhere this goes left and straight and this is just red.
Justify;because your'e talking abouta kind of combination of a rule and an action,

Justify;because--this would be interesting things tosimulate.
Justify;it seems like maybe, because then you have to then it'sseparate then you have to do them in sync. So maybe it'sreally a function of the result of how the intersections arelaid out. And the relationship between the intersection

Justify;Where it could be going. And theseare basically, these better be pointing
Justify;you can't pick up thisintersection, it would make sense to move the entire road
Lead; it should bepossible to create a busy road or a seldom used one, or any 0variation in between.
Lead; So that'scase one, that's case one. Case two would be we've got aleft-êhand turn and we're either yellow or
Lead;, that's the complication that arises when you allowthat, is you have to figure out how it's--
Lead;And as well as the signal.
Lead;And it also corresponds to time
Lead;And so the copsays okay, I try to tick, the intersections says I'm still or thatlight says I'm still green, and let's suppose this guy has rulessaying every four ticks change the colors of the lights.
Lead;And the fact that we can't have a T-êjunction keeps us fromdoing things like that, right
Lead;Controls
Lead;Directional -- okay. I'm thinking this is a queue, this is aqueue, this a queue.
Lead;evaluation should be, should we say areable to evaluate per intersection or per
Lead;I want to evaluate success of each simulation.

Motivate;I like that.
Motivate;It's the God alright, it's the master controller
Motivate;Oh, that's right, the speed of simulation
Motivate;Right, yeah
Motivate;That's true, that's true. Okay
Motivate;Well I like what you're saying, I like the idea
Motivate;Well that's a good point, though, 
Motivate;Well, let's establish the rules
Motivate;Yeah that sounds more realistic.
Motivate;Yeah. I like that.
Notation Decision;and have uml diagram for the class structureof each object's attributes
Notation Decision;so maybe once we've done that we can thinkabout uml diagrams for our class structures
Notation Decision;You mean the actual data structures?
Offer Alternative; it should bepossible to create a busy road or a seldom used one, or any 0variation in between.
Offer Alternative; Or, at leastde
Offer Alternative;. Which would be a horizontalflow or a vertical flow
Offer Alternative;aroad is an interior or we should call it an onramp
Offer Alternative;cop, we'd have kind of a cop object that youcould manipulate certain rule sets. Or is that implicit in[inaudible
Offer Alternative;Do you want to keep it or do you want to do two queues.
Offer Alternative;is the cop really a model or is that acontroller
Offer Alternative;Is this all this sort of master control orwhatever? Or should that go into where you push rulesdown to
Offer Alternative;It has a tick, tick, tick, or are we saying that alltick logic methods have a combo
Offer Alternative;it might be, or another alternative
Offer Alternative;now I'm wondering like the rule for changing the lights,we established a rule saying the light, are we going to saylight would change to green, or will only stay red for xamount of time, or is it reversed
Offer Alternative;okayone tick so from two to one, we go to zero 
Offer Alternative;One car or two
Offer Alternative;Or a left protection
Offer Alternative;Or analyzing the average wait time of a given car, right
Offer Alternative;Or are all the opposing lanesalways the same state
Offer Alternative;or are we lettingthe video camera capture that description
Offer Alternative;Or if 
Offer Alternative;or if we 
Offer Alternative;Or is this inside of a UI 
Offer Alternative;or we could even have 
Offer Alternative;or yeah I guess speed of cars, rate of incoming cars onthe onramp
Offer Alternative;Or you could say
Offer Alternative;Or you could start from the outside in and say, well for everyunbounded road,
Offer Alternative;Or you've got 
Offer Alternative;Or, I want to run it on--run a simulation for some amount oftime and evaluate the network
Offer Alternative;Or, wait. Well that's [inaudible] one cargoes per tick.
Offer Alternative;property of the queue or a property of thecar
Offer Alternative;So we makeroads, right. So one m of intersections and we would haveroad connected to the intersection or the intersection has2paths
Offer Alternative;somenumber of--so it has, think of this as kilometers, or carlengths. 
Offer Alternative;This way, or that way
Offer Alternative;Ticks per minute, orsecond. Okay
Offer Alternative;We could do it that way. Either that or we could make roadsdominant and then intersections really just a thing thathappens at road crossings.
Opinion; Is itpossible to break that down further
Opinion;A few tables
Opinion;and have uml diagram for the class structureof each object's attributes
Opinion;are all the opposing lanesalways the same state?
Opinion;Arethere any critically used cases that you want to cover?
Opinion;description?
Opinion;Did we have a constraint of only four roads per intersection?
Opinion;Do we need a specific light object?
Opinion;Do we want a reset? 
Opinion;Do we want to have it so that a car can make a turnand then change directions so that they're not always goingright?
Opinion;Do we want to then annotate
Opinion;do wechange the light a lot here? Do we flip the state of the lightsdifferently based on the state of the sensor
Opinion;Do you want to keep it or do you want to do two queues.
Opinion;do you want to write UI stories? 
Opinion;dowe want to have visualization of cars moving along aparticular road in a geometric sense? 
Opinion;how do we create a network. So yeah, good maybe7node first so this is the intersections, 
Opinion;how do you...?
Opinion;how you resize this thing. Is thisthe actual window
Opinion;Is itcapacity or average--capacity means like8
Opinion;Is that also something the cop looksat?
Opinion;Is there, put like connecting, is that
Opinion;Is this all this sort of master control orwhatever? Or should that go into where you push rulesdown to
Opinion;Now can we do this
Opinion;now do we have three states for the light? 
Opinion;One car or two
Opinion;Should we define an initial simple intersection, an initialsimple car.
Opinion;The light will only staygreen for x amount of time?
Opinion;where's the first place to start?
Opinion;you've got two left-êturners. Currently we've just gotgreen, red, and left. Do we want to introduce the yellowwhere the last left-êturner
Propose Exception; but it's not necessarily realistic
Propose Exception; But the light would then have to 
Propose Exception; But then there's 
Propose Exception; But you know 
Propose Exception;, but whatabout the--how 
Propose Exception;and have uml diagram for the class structureof each object's attributes
Propose Exception;But
Propose Exception;but 
Propose Exception;but also it'sanalytic data saying okay you're still in this queue
Propose Exception;but beginning when youjust 
Propose Exception;But I imagine the controller controls that, right, the modelbasically is just the basically cars, the queue of cars, theintersection contains four queues.
Propose Exception;But I think that would become a bit spaghetti 
Propose Exception;But if you 
Propose Exception;but let's leave observe 
Propose Exception;But not necessarilyall red.
Propose Exception;but only if 
Propose Exception;But roads
Propose Exception;but that, but this simulation 
Propose Exception;But the push is really 
Propose Exception;but then let's
Propose Exception;but then there's horizontal-êleft,vertical-êleft.
Propose Exception;but then we can 
Propose Exception;but we've 
Propose Exception;But what 
Propose Exception;Butthen
Propose Exception;butwhat's--I'd imagine 
Propose Exception;We've kind of done it here, butit's kind of messy
Reinforce; it's basically, yeah, I mean you can think of, it's aperson 
Reinforce; It's like okay I'vebeen in this state 
Reinforce;Got it. Alright
Reinforce;I like that.
Reinforce;It's the God alright, it's the master controller
Reinforce;Oh, that's right, the speed of simulation
Reinforce;Right, yeah
Reinforce;That's true, that's true. Okay
Reinforce;Well that's a good point, though, 
Reinforce;Well, let's establish the rules
Reinforce;Yeah that sounds more realistic.
Reinforce;Yeah. I like that.

Request Focus Change; Assess the load on an9intersection
Request Focus Change;Get a little more sophisticated.
Request Focus Change;I guess the other thing that would be--the other big piecehere is analytics,
Request Focus Change;let's go back to the model6for a second
Request Focus Change;maybe we can peg that for the moment and introducethat as we flush this out
Request Focus Change;Maybe we can use this space.
Request Focus Change;Okay this is getting morecomplicated
Request Focus Change;one thing I didn't think of is the popping, 
Request Focus Change;So should we talk about end [inaudible
Structural Decision; Buteach intersection gets associated with the intersection.
Structural Decision; simulationmaybe cops the wrong word and it needs to be ruler orsomething or simulator
Structural Decision;A property of the intersection
Structural Decision;And ithas a queue, which of course has push [inaudible]. Okay.
Structural Decision;And maybe the time and the currentstate. The intersection contains basically four roads.
Structural Decision;And that car is specific to [inaudible]. 
Structural Decision;And when you have something like this set up, maximumnumber of cars on this road better match the maximumnumber of cars on this road
Structural Decision;Attributes of the intersection
Structural Decision;cars, holds n.1
Structural Decision;for theconstructor of cars, what are your values for the constructor.2
Structural Decision;I almost feel like the rate at which the cars are comingshould be part of the road, because each road can have adifferent rate
Structural Decision;idea there isthat each, so then this guy has a set of visitor classes that arespecific to rural connections
Structural Decision;It has sensors and, it has the timing, current state, no it hasticks in current state
Structural Decision;It's a constraint on the number
Structural Decision;It's almost like the intersection has a state
Structural Decision;maybe the [inaudible] here is we're saying this hassome one to n, or one to 2n roads
Structural Decision;My initial thinking was you'd have intersection object thatcontained four roads they're all incoming roads
Structural Decision;Right, so clock is a controller. Have some tick then sendssome then sends tick event to model.
Structural Decision;So now do we have three states for the light? 
Structural Decision;so that's a property of the road.
Structural Decision;so tick happens and changes time, cop is watchingtime, for each tick cop has some set of rules that it knowsand based on those rules changes the queue of cars, wellmaybe those rules are really what's going on in theintersection and, you know, how fast the car is traveling say,but then there's also the notion of state of traffic so, youknow, what is that a road, some number of roads that have,and just wonder if maybe the important thing is since we aretrying to simulate traffic, traffic happens, so this road is kindof like queue, queue is the road say cuz that's what weretrying to determine is, trying to minimize the average size ofthe queue by optimizing the timing on the lights. So, theroad has a queue, blue boxes on the road and that's a[inaudible] structure
Structural Decision;Sonetwork, essentially it is a graph to create data structure
Structural Decision;That shouldbe--you don't put the logic in the object, you have atraversal class that knows how to traverse, or the traverse ishandled by a separate traverser object but then in hands-êoffcontrol, based on the type of the objet you're traversing thenthat could be a way to kind of--
Structural Decision;That's introducing to some new road, some newparameters. And then I think that in some ways add, wellthere's definitely add intersection. And that has some set ofparameters. So add road could potentially have, what's theplace you could ever, you did this. There might be an implicitstep in the network to say to keep the network modelconstraints by introducing an intersection if it needs to at ajunction. But if you wanted, I mean I'm wondering could youadd--so maybe this is public and this is private in the sensethat you only ever have roads in the network when it's at theintersections 
Structural Decision;That's kind of the beginner phase of the model, right, andinto the receiver, or we could even have it take on a model,right.
Structural Decision;The road contains basically queues that represent lanes
Structural Decision;The sim right, it's almost like, I like cop. Let's just say copwith that controls the light too.
Structural Decision;therandom number generator could saturate the space on theroads.
Structural Decision;There's a corresponding in-êroad in everyintersection. That holds the same for maximum cars
Structural Decision;There's a frequency. I'llput down specific for [inaudible].
Structural Decision;traffic cop, right, traffic copcontroller
Structural Decision;we can say horizontal and verticalbut then we can say take two lights, L1 stay, L2 stay. L1 is, onthe horizontal, is that and L2 is that. And vertical is top andbottom or something, 
Structural Decision;we say the cop 
Structural Decision;well in our world there's always atleast two lanes and the left lane is always the left laneturning
Structural Decision;Well we could leave sort of the general observe in that firstone
Structural Decision;we're saying there's a, so then, these are objects right.So, maybe what happens is the clock is the controller, it'schanging the state of time so time can tick, right, that's anamount of time. The clock does the ticking, right, and nowthe tick, time is part of model that is state, but as timechanges some cop object or something responds to timechanges, right, and is responsible for changing state ofmodel.
Structural Decision;we've gotkind of a rough sketch of the base class of the model andkind of a rough idea of the controller, which is a combinationof this cop with the visitor
Structural Decision;What I'm thinking is like you have this data structure of thistraffic cop that responds to ticks by analyzing the state of thetraffic signal and then, you know, pushes cars on and offqueue depending on the -ê
Structural Decision;would have multiple lanes so thatin a sense it has multiple queues. Where one [inaudible
Structural Decision;Would that be a property of the queue or a property of thecar
Structural Decision;you could even havedifferent subclasses of that visitor object that's
Suggest; I guess I should put wait time here, capacity here.
Suggest;Also maybe analyze the load on an intersection for road, fora particular road
Suggest;And so, should we say the initial state would be this lightsgreen and this lights green.
Suggest;And that also maybe also [inaudible] as the right hand turn
Suggest;And then depending on 3what type of car, you queue it up on the lane.
Suggest;because I think observegets into the analytics
Suggest;But I think that would become a bit spaghetti 
Suggest;cuz that's something 
Suggest;here, maybe we should do it a little moreformally
Suggest;I guess aspects of parameters of the simulation, really
Suggest;I guess in our view that's not always true
Suggest;I guess the only last thing isthere are cars that are created by the--cars that are createdessentially by the cop and introduced into onramp roads.And they have certain states, we've said.
Suggest;I guess the other thing that would be--the other big piecehere is analytics,
Suggest;I think we canassume we have a video camera rolling and we can gothrough the other scenarios
Suggest;I'm thinking that would be implicit inthe sense that I drag a road vertical, and I drag a roadhorizontal and the geometric--
Suggest;I'm wondering with half an hour left if we need to thinkabout how to--
Suggest;It might not even matter so much in that
Suggest;It's almost like you need to traffic cop, right, traffic copcontroller
Suggest;It's like there's a network kind of as well saying, okaywell we--I have, this line here says for each road in thesimulation do something. 
Suggest;Maybe this is this card, this push notion right now and just ahand wave and have it happening in a global sense
Suggest;Maybe we randomize the--at a pop and push. Wealso then randomize the actual direction of the car.
Suggest;Now left-êturn is a little more special 
Suggest;One thing we could simplify is, in order to get--because thismatters
Suggest;Say start with a model and start with the simplestmodel to get the simplest intersection flowing with cars andtiming
Suggest;So I guess then [inaudible] is no pop
Suggest;so maybe we should run through some,you know, how pictures will change from one moment oftime to another and think about how the software wouldcreate those pictures maybe.
Suggest;so what I'm thinking is maybe there's arandom number generator here that has two inputs of likebasically the probability, right
Suggest;So, let's say delta one tic maybe or something
Suggest;speed of the car
Suggest;the cop, let's do--so it has sort of rules
Suggest;there's rules governing if you have two carsgoing into the same road, which goes first per tick, 
Suggest;those are randomly generated, and maybe thetype of car has a random output
Suggest;We could make this pretty simple
Suggest;whether it has a sensor, and maybe some logic around--sortof setting in the rules we need some sort of rule editor 
Suggest;would that be a property of the car onthe current wait time or something like that
Suggest;yeah maybe let's start with thenetwork
Suggest;Yeah we could make it all horizontal and vertical roads soyou start on, off, on, off, intersection, 
Suggest Action;I want to basically I want to controlaspects of the intersection
Summarize Information; was thinking, up to this point we'vesaid intersections contain the roads 
Summarize Information;, it saysstudents must be able to describe the behavior of trafficlights on each of the intersection so that's maybe building UIfor this intersection piece where we allow the user to set atime, or set a--
Summarize Information;2C says students should be able to design eachintersection with or without the option of sensors
Summarize Information;A couple more advanced details is there's the left-êhand turn
Summarize Information;By now we select the intersection, you couldgo to the analytics now. There's a coloring of theintersection as it grows and then the specifics of theanalytics
Summarize Information;It does say...here, every intersection on the map must havetraffic signals, all intersections will be four way. There are noT-êintersections. Nor one-êway roads.
Summarize Information;I've got some ideas around intersections androads
Summarize Information;Okay so students should be ableto choose... students should be able to observe any progress4with their map's timing scheme--okay so that comes back toanalytics 
Summarize Information;random number generator is controlling push. Andthat happens for every tick.
Summarize Information;So it says here students should be able to choose the trafficdensity they're interested in on a given road
Summarize Information;So this is kind of like our cop rules, right
Summarize Information;so tick happens and changes time, cop is watchingtime
Summarize Information;Start, pause, reset. Then maybe thenext one will be added on to observe
Summarize Information;That's what we'rekind of doing here
Summarize Information;We have some constraints on the flow of 
Summarize Information;We have the notion ofqueuing and de-êqueuing
Summarize Information;we need to design the basic structure of the code thatwill be used to implement the system.
Summarize Information;We now have two 1types of car. Straight-êthrough guy and left-êturn, right turn,left-êturn.
Summarize Information;Well it does say that something that the user couldcontrol
Summarize Information;Well it says the student must be able to simulate traffic flowson the map. Students should be able to change the trafficdensity that enters the map on a given road. 
Summarize Information;what we have in our model so far is intersectionthat has the light
Suppose; if we control whether certain intersections evenallow a [inaudible
Suppose;I suppose if you just had a list of intersections it goesrandomly too 
Suppose;If it's a single lane of traffic, could those left-êturners andstraight-êthrough-êers be queued up in the same queue
Suppose;If that state is this, then the otherstates are going to be
Suppose;If the car at thehead of, well the entrance. I guess
Suppose;if there's a protected left turn thenthese need to be broken up almost.
Suppose;if they have an intersection here and here
Suppose;if this is ourcanvass and that's an onramp and that's an off ramp, youhave a special edge intersection
Suppose;if this road fills up, then even if this is green,this car won't be able to pass
Suppose;if we ever really neededthis 
Suppose;If we had some sort of--our network can be representedwith a geometry that's in kind of the window so you canscroll around
Suppose;if we haveintersection then they know about them
Suppose;if we make the capacity of the geometry and youcould sort of simulate a highway or something
Suppose;If we want to
Suppose;if we want to get more sophisticated wecould have sensor logic taking sensor for each in-êroad so thatif say these two are empty then these two just stay greenforever
Suppose;if we were playing the roles ofarchitect, how to communicate it to--so we
Suppose;if you could rearrange the networks to get thatslope, you would have
Suppose;if you double click you can controlthe frequency of the car creation on that road
Suppose;if you gothrough that's fine and then through that's fine.
Suppose;If you have multiple lanesthen you could say the left one is always turning left
Suppose;if you look at a road. It has a queue, right
Suppose;if you say you have to start with anonramp 
Suppose;if you're thinking graphically, if this iscapacity and wait time, the capacity is going to be graphedsomething like that
Suppose;if you're visiting anintersection and a road you don't have to be those thingsthere, all that logic is pretty clear there
Suppose;if youwant to take control, I'd have you say 
Suppose;Ifyou want to make it longer or shorter
Suppose;It depends if there's two lanes or not.
Suppose;It's almost as if you need to always start with an onramp sothat
Suppose;it's not full it would be allowed to
Suppose;let's supposeto you do here to here onramp, off ramp. And so this pointnow we can get an interior, now we've got an interior.
Suppose;let'ssuppose we make it so every ten ticks the lights change.Well, it might be that every five ticks, the sensor is triggered,or something like that.
Suppose;Maybe ifyou select a car, I mean a road, it allows you to edit
Suppose;Numerical decision data. Averagewait time, three hours. And I wonder if we want to allowuser control of a clock in the sense that relating the notion ofthis tick time to real time. 
Suppose;say if this is the head. Sothe speed controls, like for every tick how many spaces a carcan move
Suppose;so let's suppose T onerepresent a delta 
Suppose;So then, so suppose, so we're going to have thecars done in one tic right.
Suppose;So, let's suppose we start with, say this picture is T zero.What would, okay so they can't, let's suppose for a momentthat T zero has all the lights about to change, so in the sensethat wherever I just point in time nothing's moving and we'reshowing x point in time where something has moved sort ofbefore and after state.
Suppose;Suppose you have even a simulationobject, it has a clock and a network and here's the clock andit tells the clock time
Suppose;thatif a car went from here--so what we'd see right now in ourvisualization is that in queue we see it pop to the front of thequeue
Suppose;There might be an implicitstep in the network to say to keep the network modelconstraints by introducing an intersection if it needs to at ajunction
Suppose;there's rules governing if you have two carsgoing into the same road, which goes first per tick, 
Suppose;this road is geometrically shorter, then thisessentially is saying all roads are the same length
Suppose;when I hit theplay button, it kicks the ticks going and now we have all ofour random number generators feeding cars into thenetwork
Suppose;you have an analyticspiece looking in and assessing questions like
Suppose;you're trying to do the yield, you know trying tosimulate the yield rule, right
Task; Assess the load on an9intersection
Task; Okay so it says that's up to us
Task; was thinking, up to this point we'vesaid intersections contain the roads 
Task;, it saysstudents must be able to describe the behavior of trafficlights on each of the intersection so that's maybe building UIfor this intersection piece where we allow the user to set atime, or set a--
Task;2C says students should be able to design eachintersection with or without the option of sensors
Task;A couple more advanced details is there's the left-êhand turn
Task;And nowshould we try 
Task;And then come up with progressively--start off with thesimplest user story, and then progressively add user stories3and then maybe have pictures to illustrate how in our systemthose user stories will be achieved
Task;At least we can go through it right now. A few tables
Task;By now we select the intersection, you couldgo to the analytics now. There's a coloring of theintersection as it grows and then the specifics of theanalytics
Task;fifteen minutes into documenting,talking about the engineering design, code structure
Task;Get a little more sophisticated.
Task;I guess the other thing that would be--the other big piecehere is analytics,
Task;I guess we should write some of these things down.
Task;I was thinking we could startwith what we have now and fall on a user story of runningthis simulation now. 
Task;I'm sort of reminded of the fact that we're supposed to allowlights to have sets of rules
Task;I'm wondering with half an hour left if we need to thinkabout how to--
Task;It does say...here, every intersection on the map must havetraffic signals, all intersections will be four way. There are noT-êintersections. Nor one-êway roads.
Task;I've got some ideas around intersections androads
Task;let's go back to the model6for a second
Task;Let's sketch a UI
Task;maybe we can peg that for the moment and introducethat as we flush this out
Task;maybe we can peg that for the moment and introducethat as we flush this out.
Task;Maybe we can use this space.
Task;Maybe we should start talking about the U
Task;Okay so students should be ableto choose... students should be able to observe any progress4with their map's timing scheme--okay so that comes back toanalytics 
Task;Okay this is getting morecomplicated
Task;one thing I didn't think of is the popping, 
Task;random number generator is controlling push. Andthat happens for every tick.
Task;Should we start soon?
Task;So basic--design a basic structure of code.So to me, that's where we've got the model. The model anda little bit of how controller controls the model.
Task;So it says here students should be able to choose the trafficdensity they're interested in on a given road
Task;So should we talk about end [inaudible
Task;So should we talk about end [inaudible
Task;So this is kind of like our cop rules, right
Task;so tick happens and changes time, cop is watchingtime
Task;Start, pause, reset. Then maybe thenext one will be added on to observe
Task;That's what we'rekind of doing here
Task;We have some constraints on the flow of 
Task;We have the notion ofqueuing and de-êqueuing
Task;we need to design the basic structure of the code thatwill be used to implement the system.
Task;We now have two 1types of car. Straight-êthrough guy and left-êturn, right turn,left-êturn.
Task;Well it does say that something that the user couldcontrol
Task;Well it says the student must be able to simulate traffic flowson the map. Students should be able to change the trafficdensity that enters the map on a given road. 
Task;well let's stick to the grid
Task;Well now, intersection class
Task;We'll tackle that when we get there
Task;well we can write that down
Task;what we have in our model so far is intersectionthat has the light
Task;where's the first place to start?
Task;yeah maybe let's start with thenetwork
Usability and User Interface; And thenfor each intersection you can double click--and thencontrols some of the
Usability and User Interface; there's a play andpause button on the clock or something
Usability and User Interface; we'll just pause it and reset it and now, again maybenow we can speak to the analytics pieces
Usability and User Interface; Whichbasically, I'm just going to write on the board, average waittime, average capacity on the road or
Usability and User Interface; you click an edge and you have to connect that tosomething that exists in the network
Usability and User Interface;although I mean theoretically you could do somethinglike this 
Usability and User Interface;And as you drag it out it kind of shows you how many cars
Usability and User Interface;And here, and what not.And so then drag it and the it automatically connects and asyou move this back and forth it increases the capacity for thisroad so now 
Usability and User Interface;And the way they do that, hit the start button.
Usability and User Interface;And then maybe in order to control the flow of the on-êramp,you can click on, here
Usability and User Interface;And then, so now. Now because you have something there,you theoretically go drag down and drag and make aconnection there so now you've got a--except it's got to befour ways so how does that work. And the end becomestricky
Usability and User Interface;Because now as you drag thisone over you've got to make sure to drag that one over
Usability and User Interface;Car, click with the mouse [inaudible]. Certainly,we'd like to be able to click a car and see analytics for thatcar. And it might be that we want to select a car and watchthat particular car snake through the simulation.
Usability and User Interface;could have a slider tosay I want to see this simulation whiz by, or no I'd really liketo watch that simulation unfold and see what the blockage ison that particular intersection and so that will slow thespeed down. So this is a ticks per second slider
Usability and User Interface;Highlight a specific car and see for that
Usability and User Interface;I drag a road vertical, and I drag a roadhorizontal and the geometric--
Usability and User Interface;If we had some sort of--our network can be representedwith a geometry that's in kind of the window so you canscroll around
Usability and User Interface;if you double click you can controlthe frequency of the car creation on that road
Usability and User Interface;It's almost like we need a little pallet of intersections
Usability and User Interface;just drag one here and drag one thereright? So once you drag this one here you have to specifyhow that one's connected, 
Usability and User Interface;Next thing would be like color as a gross levelvisualization and like you say you click sensitive, you actuallysee numerical values
Usability and User Interface;One way that I found effective in communicating UIinteraction is user stories
Usability and User Interface;Or is this inside of a UI 
Usability and User Interface;out a horizontal lineand drag out a vertical line so that the intersection pops intoexistence at some geometric crossing. 
Usability and User Interface;Right so this is now a UI piece and the dot, brings up youreditor with frequency of, your frequency value
Usability and User Interface;see average wait time, analytics,average capacity of the roads, average cars, these kind of
Usability and User Interface;So that if the user andthe UI draws another road somewhere
Usability and User Interface;So the empty network is what we started outwith a blank page, as they drag a road on, that instantiates aroad object
Usability and User Interface;Soyou double click on the onramp widget and then say
Usability and User Interface;Start, observe, and then we'll put pause
Usability and User Interface;The onramp is receiving cars, visually queue upand then visually release
Usability and User Interface;the way you do that is you click on the edges tocreate roads and then where the roads meet you haveintersections.
Usability and User Interface;then based on how a user controls sliders to0create traffic jams or what have you, or adjust timings on thelights, or the speed of the cars, 
Usability and User Interface;Then you can drag other nodes, more intersections 
Usability and User Interface;this could be contact sensitive, right soyou click on an intersection and it shows you average waittime.
Usability and User Interface;this means the analytics--sodashboard and [inaudible] some things. Maybe coded onthe car, the representation of the car. It's been waiting and itgoes red, if the road is [inaudible] a gridlock, it goes to red, ifit's free-êflowing it goes to green, this kind of stuff. So youget a nice colorful visualization of the efficacy [inaudible
Usability and User Interface;We can do that along the rules the cop is using, potentially,the frequency values around number generators potentially,the state of sensors, all these parametric controls of thesimulation we need to build UI for user controls.
Usability and User Interface;We show a different view in UI states, 
Usability and User Interface;you can't pick up thisintersection, it would make sense to move the entire road
Usability and User Interface;You could make it thicker. Visual indicationthat's the max number is a lot, that increases the...
Usability and User Interface;you havea slider that says busy, up and down busy or empty
Usability and User Interface;you havemaybe you have these intersection objects that you dragonto the--well let's...
Use Case;as a user, I want to...create an intersection
Use Case;can say, okay clear all the cars, play again.
Use Case;Could you have the case where you could makea mass left here but not there. 
Use Case;either the user willnow want to initiate a simulation in this very simple network,maybe
Use Case;forthe users to be able to change or control the simulation
Use Case;I as a user of this system want to createa road in my simulation 
Use Case;Numerical decision data. Averagewait time, three hours. And I wonder if we want to allowuser control of a clock in the sense that relating the notion ofthis tick time to real time. 
Use Case;So right now nothingexists in the network so the only other thing is--so that's anonramp and that's an off ramp--so you can only create anonramp and off ramp initially
Use Case;that affects the car you're creating.And how quickly you're creating.
Use Case;then based on how a user controls sliders to0create traffic jams or what have you, or adjust timings on thelights, or the speed of the cars, 
Use Case;thinking of acase where a user could actually put down an intersectionswithout violating a constraint.
Use Case;Yeah, erase... you've got basically a blank slate. And well youstart, drag an intersection but basically drag an intersectiononto the thing. And then
Use Case;you're adding a roadto the network an there's constraints on what kind of roadsyou can add and sets up the interior versus onrampdesignation so

Agree;I would somehow separate it too
Agree;No

Agree;Yeah
Agree;Yeah, because it has to be adjusted to however fast you canpossibly be going
Apologize;I'm sorry
Argue; But how 
Argue; So once the car exists
Argue;, if you click on here and double click on here then there'ssome form that
Argue;Although
Argue;although wemight duplicate that down here so that they can keep track ofit
Argue;And what kind of metrics or ideas does she have aroundsuccess or failure of a given, of a simulation
Argue;ayout on here well I definitely want itred for this whole period, and definitely red while it's yellow,and then there should be a little bit of an overlap. Maybesomething tha

Argue;But at the same 
Argue;but given what we have we think you can start ona prototype.
Argue;but I think
Argue;but ideally you'd want to have an ability for thesystem to self?adjust so that would be like the second stagewhere you go and figure 
Argue;But it's not 
Argue;but the thing is
Argue;But then again
Argue;but there's not a lot of, you 
Argue;butI
Argue;butthat
Argue;Cars are independent ofintersections I feel
Argue;each approach has a different light, or we could putthem in pairs where the north and south approaches both havethe same light signals.
Argue;f south has a green arrow, then
Argue;I almost wonder if, I don't know.

Argue;I don't know if Professor E really wants that level ofdetail
Argue;I don't know if they can set thespeeds
Argue;I don't know if you can changethese as well while you're going.
Argue;I don't know if. But youalready got this on there,
Argue;I don't know so much
Argue;I don't know,
Argue;I don't know,
Argue;I don't know,
Argue;I don't know.
Argue;I don't knowthat almost feels like
Argue;I don'tknow
Argue;I don'tknow exactly how to capture this
Argue;I would somehow separate it too
Argue;if
Argue;if
Argue;if
Argue;If
Argue;if
Argue;if
Argue;if
Argue;if
Argue;If
Argue;if the speed on this street is25mph, adding relay, how long should it take you to go thisdistance
Argue;if this is green, then y
Argue;if we had alittle more time
Argue;if you want tosimulate it, you have to know
Argue;I'm not reallysure
Argue;I'm not sure.
Argue;I'm saying
Argue;I'm still thinking
Argue;is part of the intersection
Argue;it'd have to be in 60 because you'd only get [inaudible] onthe green, [inaudible] on the red
Argue;know there is an overlap when both of them are red,because people run yellow lights, and they run red lights at theend so you'd get a collision
Argue;meaninglittle dots are moving, showing you how the traffic is flowing
Argue;n red for the remainder, andthen
Argue;No
Argue;Now I don't know
Argue;o
Argue;Oh that's not going to quite work.
Argue;Okay, so that's another thing we want to be able to specify indrawing.
Argue;Or
Argue;Or

Argue;Or
Argue;or
Argue;Or
Argue;or
Argue;or did I readsomething there that said it has some
Argue;Or maybe allow cycleable defaults
Argue;or, again we could
Argue;Or, it could be you can drawwhile you're simulating.
Argue;So
Argue;So

Argue;So
Argue;So
Argue;so
Argue;so
Argue;So
Argue;so
Argue;so I think it'sa little confusing.
Argue;So it would be 50 seconds
Argue;So it's almost lik
Argue;So it's like a drawing tool that can allow them to lay downthese intersections
Argue;So maybe that's a separate setting.
Argue;So one thing is
Argue;So that's what I was getting at
Argue;So the 
Argue;So the intersection 
Argue;So the traffic pattern 
Argue;So then it's divided pretty much between green and...
Argue;So then this would be intersection B2.
Argue;So there is a finite number
Argue;So this can get fairly complex very fast because you have allthese intersections
Argue;so we don't need to really place traffic lights,
Argue;so you couldn't 
Argue;So you're going to have
Argue;That's kind of good down here
Argue;then
Argue;There's kind of a drawing area here
Argue;This is where we still have a little doubt
Argue;Well, by controlling it at an individual car level you end upcontrolling the flow
Argue;Well, so one little thing besides laying out the roads. Weneed some kind of visualization of the map
Argue;Yeah
Argue;Yeah, because it has to be adjusted to however fast you canpossibly be going
Argue;you have to have green arrow and red arrow
Argue;youhave the instance of the car, the car knows where it's going. Sothe car comes, and does some sort of hand?shaking with theroad and the road knows it has this 
Assumption;Again, this would all assume they're regularly placed roads andintersections, right?
Assumption;alwaysvery short
Assumption;And also, traffic speed throughout.
Assumption;and I do believe that we need categoriesof cars
Assumption;And so, clearly no way for people to be able to label thesepretty quickly because there's some information, like we needto track each intersection what roads are connecting
Assumption;and then I believe each car shouldbe able to report to you how long it waited
Assumption;and we have to add in the left?turn arrows, that adds insome complexity.
Assumption;And what kind of metrics or ideas does she have aroundsuccess or failure of a given, of a simulation
Assumption;And whether there's sensors
Assumption;Are north and south the same?
Assumption;assume
Assumption;assume
Assumption;assume we have the streets divided into sections
Assumption;be a very subtle manner: changing the timing at asingle intersection by a couple of seconds can have farreachingeffects on the traffic in the surrounding areas
Assumption;but each time two things there is some sort of a graphicindicating there is an intersection
Assumption;But we are assuming straight lines. [inaudible] Straight streetsonly.
Assumption;cars are going to back up
Assumption;categories of cars
Assumption;city so...
Assumption;combination ofthe density at certain hours and for a given intersection, apercentage, what you expect to go left right or straight for thathour.
Assumption;could changeduring the daytime
Assumption;do have sensor
Assumption;Do weassume, did it say that the intersection has definite trafficlights?
Assumption;each car has to have a destination
Assumption;each of these has a density
Assumption;erpendicular grid.
Assumption;exactly the distance betweeneach intersection, you have to know how fast is the maximumspeed that the cars could possibly be going, so how long does ittake to get from one intersection to another, so if you left at agreen light, from one point.
Assumption;for each approach you can say whether it has a sensor or aleft signal
Assumption;For theroads, we're going to have the main one because we're going tohave to
Assumption;green arrow and red arrow
Assumption;Has green arrow both ways,
Assumption;have sensors that detect
Assumption;here you pump in traffic from theedges of the streets.
Assumption;how she typically provides traffic densities, anddirectional choices to her students
Assumption;I supposethere's some traffic speeds at which these cars travel. Theyprobably vary. So we'd have to assume that from oneintersection to another it can be different. So if they go fromhere to here at 25 max and here 35 is that
Assumption;I think it's just saying you have to have more than just regulargreen
Assumption;I think the intersections just occur.
Assumption;I'd probably points on coordinate righ
Assumption;if the speed on this street is25mph, adding relay, how long should it take you to go thisdistance?
Assumption;ike it could be like the left?hand turn signalhere and here but from this road there's not so. It might not befor the intersection as a whole, maybe there's actually fourobjects here approaching the intersection
Assumption;I'm not sure if the speed is affected by the timing ofthe traffic lights.
Assumption;intersections
Assumption;it has to have a starting point,
Assumption;It pretty much is to control the lights.
Assumption;leftrightturn sensors
Assumption;like this many cars come in per minute goingthis direction.
Assumption;Maximum number of cars at a given red light, and the average
Assumption;Maybe the way to approach it is that there's an overall cycletiming that can be equally divided among all lights and thenyou start screwing with it if you want to. So there's somedefault that saysó
Assumption;Okay so the distance, it seems like if we're not going to havecurving roads
Assumption;Okay, and then there's the density controls
Assumption;Okay, so we don't need to really place traffic lights, they'reassumed tható
Assumption;ou want to pump a single car through the system and youwant to be able to specify where it starts and where it's going/
Assumption;percentage of cars do you expect to be goingstraight, making a left turn, and making a right turn.
Assumption;percentagethat turn at the intersection
Assumption;presumably
Assumption;separate objec
Assumption;So each leg, yeah.
Assumption;So for each block, we have the name and block, how far it is,and how long it should take to travel that if you have a greenlight given the speed on the street.
Assumption;so it's got an infinite number of roads and intersectionsyou can lay out.
Assumption;So then it's divided pretty much between green and...
Assumption;So there's also a leg or a segway
Assumption;So this is kind of a sidewalk
Assumption;some mechanism we can reference each
Assumption;somehow time, daytime, the time of the... possibly also playsa rol
Assumption;Something needsto be grade
Assumption;speeds of the roads
Assumption;starting where is it going
Assumption;streets or roads
Assumption;That shouldn't turn green untilat least after the yellow is done
Assumption;That's the distribution of a given car
Assumption;The businesses betweeneach intersection influence so how far you know is betweenone and two
Assumption;The left?hand turns are protected,
Assumption;The second one isspecifying the parameters at each intersection: does it haveleft, how long, yeah
Assumption;then this is going to affectwhat colors or how they're going to work here
Assumption;then we know that the time
Assumption;thenumber of cars that pass through per minute
Assumption;there's a duration of thecycle
Assumption;there's alwaysgoing to be wait times
Assumption;There's intersections, and streets
Assumption;There's roads, and then there's like names and a speed
Assumption;there's some cars that youknow, again, volkswagon vs mercedes that have certaincharacteristics. You know
Assumption;There's something about the light, eachlight has some kind of timing settings.
Assumption;thestreet should be able to tell you going north or south or east orwest
Assumption;They can set the density.
Assumption;They need to place roads,intersections
Assumption;they're allmaking left.
Assumption;This is done in real time.
Assumption;traffic lights aredifferent
Assumption;traffic lights usually in city streets,are set up so people go just the traffic speed and if they go toofast, then they hit a red light, and if they hit a green light andstay the speed limit then they usually stay and go greenthroughout and so then on a given street, all the lights have tobe timed in such a way that if you follow that speed limit thenyou will get to the next green light and you'll never have tostop as long as you stay at the speed limit
Assumption;two modes: an editingmode and a simulation mode
Assumption;we want the carsthemselves also to know where they are at
Assumption;we'll want to build it in to our diagram to say how they're allrelated
Assumption;We're not generating new traffic from inside the grid
Assumption;where are the streets, what are they, how long the distancesbetween them and all that.
Assumption;Which is, I guess where you'd want to start your simulation.Kind of uniformly distributed.
Assumption;Yeah, butthat doesn't really necessarily tell you, it also doesn't say that ifyou have two streets that are a mile long and the averagespeed is 25, the best timingó
Assumption;yellow transition time.
Assumption;you can say a street can report data to you
Assumption;you need kind of a summary area to kind oftell you what your settings are for the individual intersections,and what kind of effect, like how much is the traffic backup atthis light, or what's the average wait?time at this light
Assumption;You need to characterize the cars
Assumption;you turn left first
Assumption;you would have to moveseveral blocks at the same time.
Assumption;youhave the instance of the car, the car knows where it's going. Sothe car comes, and does some sort of hand?shaking with theroad and the road knows it has this 
Assumption;You're at a red light and then you turnleft
Assumption;Youwant to change the behaviors of the cars without changing thebehaviors of the intersection
Behavioural Decision;0 to 50on the timeline, is going to be green
Behavioural Decision;And this way too, and all four of these
Behavioural Decision;And you could saythat the whole cycle duration is, I don't know, 2 minutes orsomething equally divided
Behavioural Decision;average 40 seconds b
Behavioural Decision;c lightproblem is figuring out how long we should have theoverlapping red lights to avoid accidents.
Behavioural Decision;car is going on the road, it approaches the intersection.
Behavioural Decision;constant speed throughout?
Behavioural Decision;cycle duration
Behavioural Decision;cycleable defaults
Behavioural Decision;een arrow, then it changes.
Behavioural Decision;green arrow on at the same time
Behavioural Decision;he cars keep appearing, going,appearing, going.
Behavioural Decision;he cars should be going straight, goingleft?right?left?right, going two lefts, one right, left, you know.Just toóso have like, lets say four or five basic categories ofcars
Behavioural Decision;just to even see whether the traffic ismoving at all, they're all going straight.
Behavioural Decision;number of carsthat are waiting at a red light
Behavioural Decision;overall cycletiming
Behavioural Decision;program a littlecar
Behavioural Decision;smarts does the [inaudible] have toprecrude you from laying out something that will causeaccidents
Behavioural Decision;So if you're traveling north on something, then at thestart of the cycle, it's going to start green so
Behavioural Decision;So there's 120 seconds we want broken into
Behavioural Decision;So there's no yellow there,the red is for 65 then.
Behavioural Decision;So wecan assume for this full 55 seconds that this has to be red
Behavioural Decision;that all of A has the same speed
Behavioural Decision;that's what the light would do
Behavioural Decision;the top of the cycle followed by, Idon't know, 10 seconds of yellow, followed by how about 55here. So then 55 seconds of red for the north approach. And forthe south approach, we do the same thing.
Behavioural Decision;there's both greens, then the north south is, they're allmaking left.
Behavioural Decision;there's like a random numbergenerator.
Behavioural Decision;This can bechanged during the simulation
Behavioural Decision;upposed to let them get in collisions, so maybe there's northsouthhere and east?west here, and so if this is in green, andthis is in red for 55 seconds
Behavioural Decision;waits for theintersection to tell it that it's okay to go. 
Behavioural Decision;We have to be able to describe the behavior of thetraffic lights at each intersection.
Behavioural Decision;youcould just say 100 and distribute evenly.
Clarification;And what does that mean?
Clarification;But what constitutes a well?movingtraffic
Clarification;But what does the intersection, what is the purpose of theintersection in life
Clarification;right
Communication Decision;approach what the traffic configuration
Communication Decision;tells the intersection
Communication Decision;theintersection tells the car,
Coordinate Group Process;does the professor want the students to learn that through trialand error
Coordinate Group Process;goal is that as many cars are moving at any given time asclose to speed limit as possible
Coordinate Group Process;his is always the point where I'm scared toerase the board. We need to take a picture of that.
Coordinate Group Process;it's kind of like I go back, like what is exactly theoutput, you kno
Coordinate Group Process;Letme erase over here. It's this stuff that I'm worried about. It'skind of sketchy.
Coordinate Group Process;Lets assume this, lets assume it's inside a city so...
Coordinate Group Process;summarize the unclaritiesthat we had for Professor E
Coordinate Group Process;This is something where I'd go back to the customer and tryand figure out
Coordinate Group Process;This is when I pull out my camera
Coordinate Group Process;This is why we need to check with theprofessor again

Doubt;or did I readsomething there that said it has some
Doubt;This is where we still have a little doubt
Elaborate;also
Elaboration;, this would be visible
Elaboration;I mean how do you visualize this simulation
Elaboration;what does that mean?
Elaboration;What else are we going to be drawing?
Encourage;When Jim is present, only Jim does the board, as you see hishand?writing, his ability to use markers is remarkable, so noone approaches the board, he's very good.
Explain and Clarify; the traffic pattern object, the big guy, owns all the cars,and as it manufactures them, as it factors them out, it createsthem in some flavor, 
Explain and Clarify;And by default it eitherhas or does not have a timing setting, so very quickly you cancreate something without fussing with it too much, and bydefault it has to assume
Explain and Clarify;but I'm saying that you would say that 10% of cars willbehave like this, 10% will go straight, 10% will go tointersections and turn
Explain and Clarify;how do you assess, you know, what is the optimalósothis is the grid, what is the optimal setting of the intersectionconfigurations with this traffic pattern.
Explain and Clarify;how far is it between each leg orwhatever, each segment.
Explain and Clarify;So we assume they have some sort of a pallet here where theygrab a road and they start dragging and then they drag that, sothere is some sort of drawing pallet right, that says okay I havethis thing I drag something, I'm drawing a road and I call itsomething and I draw and I call it B and I draw my roads andthen.
Explain and Clarify;that, and it also pushesit up to the road, so the road can aggregate, create the reportslater for all the intersections it has so we can aggregate thesething, so you can aggregate so you can get individualinformation on each car, on each intersection, on each road
Explain and Clarify;the intersection knows how many cars it has, and fullinventory of each car's direction, status, waiting, and waitingfor what. 
Explain and Clarify;This is an approach
Functionality;And then as those thingschange during the simulationówell as they move things theycan see how the distance changed, and you can see the time ittakes to travel at a given speed
Functionality;And then the editing
Functionality;And we have cars that are kindof generated
Functionality;and you want to name the simulation.
Functionality;asave simulation
Functionality;both knows the speed limits, wants to control it, at thesame time the traffic lights want to prevent you from speeding,so it's like all these things.
Functionality;clicking a sensor is going to have to require furtherconfiguration
Functionality;eseteverybody to the same
Functionality;generate these
Functionality;havingdefaults
Functionality;I like the idea of being able to somehow, while it's running,see the net effect of, you know, dialing, messing with the dialsof some sort
Functionality;I'm thinking there's kind of this edit mode, sowe're editing the map, that's the first thing, you can drawroads, move roads, assign speeds, so there's something overó
Functionality;o in and edit it and say well let mechange
Functionality;randomdistribution
Functionality;report on that
Functionality;road can tell you how many cars it has traveling on it, andwhich direction they traveling
Functionality;save thesimulation
Functionality;save what the setting are
Functionality;saving?modeor reporting?mod
Functionality;So intersectionconfiguration, and now car configuration is part of theconjestion
Functionality;So you only set one, but the overlap of the red and theduration of the yellow is something you can set.
Functionality;the other ones are impliedb
Functionality;the way you would divide it up is by, you knowthere's definitely a chunk of work to do just with the map andthe graphics and building that all [inaudible] with regard tohow do you create the map. How do youóyou know, a lotmore detail with regard to interacting with it.
Functionality;two modes: an editingmode and a simulation mode
Functionality;visualizing
Functionality;we have to make surethese add up to 100
Functionality;will look at the map, and give yousome sort of a grid
Functionality;You could choose to sort them if you wanted to sort
Functionality;you couldlike specify a hot spot on the grid
Functionality;you have a ranking of intersections or intersectionapproaches
Functionality;you wouldn't really enter them, they'd kind ofjust be calculated for you based one how you laid that out asyou move things, maybe we'd actually show you what the
Functionality;you're starting a new simulation.
Implementation Decision;permutations that happen at eachintersection
Implementation Decision;reallywhen you're filling out stuff about an intersection, you're fillingout information about each of the approaches
Implementation Decision;this in html.Reporting 
Infer; So once the car exists
Infer;it'd have to be in 60 because you'd only get [inaudible] onthe green, [inaudible] on the red
Infer;know there is an overlap when both of them are red,because people run yellow lights, and they run red lights at theend so you'd get a collision
Infer;meaninglittle dots are moving, showing you how the traffic is flowing

Inform;but I'm saying that you would say that 10% of cars willbehave like this, 10% will go straight, 10% will go tointersections and turn
Inform;but its not necessary
Inform;But Jim did we finish with the cars kind of
Inform;But you know that you brought up a point you know
Inform;cause there's a lot of complexity
Inform;deally, thesystem should be able to
Inform;either
Inform;erhaps theres
Inform;hat's going to cause traffic problems here.
Inform;how do you assess, you know, what is the optimalósothis is the grid, what is the optimal setting of the intersectionconfigurations with this traffic pattern.
Inform;how far is it between each leg orwhatever, each segment.
Inform;I could see in subsequent versions
Inform;I feel likeyou should have to specify only maybe two directions orsomething
Inform;I guess
Inform;I guess
Inform;I guess
Inform;I guess that's all.
Inform;I just think
Inform;I like it better down there
Inform;I mean
Inform;I mean we couldjust say, you know, the distance between 1st street and 2ndstreet is this,
Inform;I mean, we have to state this because if it's notó
Inform;I think
Inform;I think
Inform;I think
Inform;I think
Inform;I think
Inform;I think
Inform;I think
Inform;I think
Inform;I think
Inform;I think
Inform;I think
Inform;I think from the user's perspective
Inform;I think it's just saying
Inform;I think that's an importantpart of it
Inform;I think the intersections just occur.
Inform;I think this
Inform;I think we kind of covered all thethings we wrote up here
Inform;I think wehave to talk to Professor E again, because she didn't specify themost important aspect of it, which is how do you know thatyour lighting system is working to its best potential? I candraw the map, I can specify all these parameters and now I runit, how do I know this is good
Inform;I think we're going to have to rely on professor E forcreating the details about the theory of how that works. I mean,we might have to code whatever her understanding is of trafficlight theory into it
Inform;I want to do
Inform;I would go
Inform;I would probably wantto be able to hover and somehow in?place edit
Inform;I would say
Inform;if
Inform;I'll tell you what's going to be interesting is these students,whether there's civil engineers but, you know they're doingcomputer science stuff, so their next step after this is to takethe software that you've been given and program the smartsinto it so that it can do the timing for you automatically.
Inform;I'm entertaining this idea
Inform;I'm still unhappy
Inform;I'm thinking
Inform;I'mguessing
Inform;In other words
Inform;in other words
Inform;In other words
Inform;In other words
Inform;In other words
Inform;In other words it would seem to me that ideally you'dwant to draw this out of the box with all defaults and somedefault settings based on some package
Inform;In other words,
Inform;In the real world, you know, A can becurving and intersect 1 three times, and do an S and dead?end.
Inform;is the traffic kind ofóyou know how some you havegreen one way but not on the other.
Inform;Is there a sensor?'
Inform;It almost seems like
Inform;it also seems
Inform;it didn't sound like you need control at the individual carlevel
Inform;it does seemlike
Inform;It might
Inform;It might be
Inform;It seems like here,
Inform;Ithink
Inform;Let's start coding
Inform;Like during commuting hours everyoneworks over there, but the shopping center is down there, so onweekends everyone is going that way.
Inform;like it could be like
Inform;Maybe
Inform;Maybe even you could
Inform;maybe just click here
Inform;Maybe the way to approach
Inform;Maybe theres also
Inform;maybe this is just a learning tool
Inform;Next release we'll let them add theirown fancy street names
Inform;o I would take the map drawingas one thing
Inform;o Professor E says,this is your exam this is your project, here is a traffic pattern,this is the grid, what is the optimal traffic light settings? Figurethat out. And so how do you, you know, and again I think itwould be up to the customer, the professor, in this case, tospecify what optimal means, what is allowed wait?time, howmany traffic, you know people waiting on the lights, right, all ofthat.
Inform;Of course we're not going and talking to her, we're going to talkto the team of software developers
Inform;Okay so then we have a map
Inform;Okay, I say I want fifty cars on the grid, but I don't want themall going the same way.
Inform;one thing that we're kind of missing there
Inform;Right now I would just leave it
Inform;should not allow
Inform;so
Inform;so
Inform;So I think
Inform;So I would start simple, Jim.
Inform;So if we did 2 minutes, that's 120 seconds. So the entireduration is 120 seconds
Inform;so it could be
Inform;So let's build
Inform;So let's just say for
Inform;so lets say somehow we figure it all out and we'reable to pump traffic through it
Inform;So maybe that's a separate setting. In other words, the durationof each light you set it on, maybe 1 or 2 but the other one isimplied. Because if this is green, then you cannot tell thesystem to make the other one green as well it just won'thappen. So you only set one, but the overlap of the red and theduration of the yellow is something you can set.
Inform;So that'slike a final stage, how do you report the results
Inform;so the form needs to be
Inform;So there's lik
Inform;So this can get fairly complex very fast because you have allthese intersections
Inform;So we assume they have some sort of a pallet here where theygrab a road and they start dragging and then they drag that, sothere is some sort of drawing pallet right, that says okay I havethis thing I drag something, I'm drawing a road and I call itsomething and I draw and I call it B and I draw my roads andthen.
Inform;"So what does ""it worked"" mean?"
Inform;So why don't we start out
Inform;So you don't have to
Inform;So, like yousaid, if you click on here and double click on here then there'ssome form that lets you collect the information about thatintersection.
Inform;Soyou can mix and match
Inform;t does seem like it would begood
Inform;t has a computer, I would have to think about it reallyhard.
Inform;talk through this with me
Inform;that it would have tobe like flex or something
Inform;That why I though
Inform;that, and it also pushesit up to the road, so the road can aggregate, create the reportslater for all the intersections it has so we can aggregate thesething, so you can aggregate so you can get individualinformation on each car, on each intersection, on each road
Inform;The distances, you know
Inform;the intersection knows how many cars it has, and fullinventory of each car's direction, status, waiting, and waitingfor what. 
Inform;The left?hand turns are
Inform;Then I think
Inform;then it makes it easier tokind of find it and it maps really closely to what you see overhere.
Inform;there because doingit on the side can get kind of confusing
Inform;There has to be
Inform;There might be
Inform;There was something about reducing wait?time and
Inform;think
Inform;think that
Inform;this has to be like the main objec
Inform;This is an approach
Inform;want tostart off and say I have
Inform;We
Inform;We build a flex application
Inform;We could have
Inform;we could talk to the engineers too
Inform;We have to be able to describe the behavior of thetraffic lights at each intersection.
Inform;We haven't really,this is where we find some conflict
Inform;we haven't yet worked thesensors
Inform;We need to collect it as part of the approach to the intersection
Inform;we still have to do thedetail design for how you specify these numbers
Inform;well itdepends
Inform;Well, these are almost given
Inform;What does ramming mean
Inform;what does that mean? What isthe sensor sensoring? Or detecting?
Inform;with or without an optionto
Inform;Yeah, because that's a huge wrinkle if it's not.
Inform;you can just give it a density andit just follows these rules
Inform;You know, in some ways it seems
Inform;you know, we should think about that
Inform;You need some control with the flow
Inform;you start simply.
Inform;You'd set a rate
Inform;you're completely just withdrawing the map
Information;And where do you see
Information;Are there other objects?
Information;but does it have only lefthand?
Information;distances, and density relate to it?
Information;he second?
Information;How do you know who's waiting and why
Information;that green is on?
Information;Then, what was the information wehad
Information;What are the goals, and how are they set
Information;Where was the part where there was something about waittime
Justification;because
Justification;because you would have to moveseveral blocks at the same time.
Justify;And that's my point
Justify;becaues
Justify;because
Justify;Because
Justify;Because
Justify;because

Justify;Because
Justify;Because
Justify;because
Justify;because
Justify;because
Justify;Because
Justify;because
Justify;because
Justify;because in real life some intersections you cannot.
Justify;because it knows where it's going
Justify;because thatjust made it complex
Justify;because the road knows about intersections, and then thewhole map.
Justify;becauseas you start adjusting here it would go here as you wouldósoyou can almost go infinite here so it has to, you just give it.
Justify;Becauseotherwise
Justify;becausethat'd
Justify;but
Justify;but its not necessary
Justify;cause there's a lot of complexity
Justify;hat's going to cause traffic problems here.
Justify;I mean
Justify;I mean, we have to state this because if it's notó
Justify;if
Justify;In the real world, you know, A can becurving and intersect 1 three times, and do an S and dead?end.
Justify;is the traffic kind ofóyou know how some you havegreen one way but not on the other.

Justify;so
Justify;so
Justify;So maybe that's a separate setting. In other words, the durationof each light you set it on, maybe 1 or 2 but the other one isimplied.

Justify;Yeah, because that's a huge wrinkle if it's not.
Lead;And then there's some way to
Lead;But Jim did we finish with the cars kind of
Lead;But you know that you brought up a point you know
Lead;I think it's just saying
Lead;I think wehave to talk to Professor E again, because she didn't specify themost important aspect of it, which is how do you know thatyour lighting system is working to its best potential? I candraw the map, I can specify all these parameters and now I runit, how do I know this is good

Lead;you start simply.
Lead;you're completely just withdrawing the map
Listening;I understand what you mean
Maintenance;And this is a real?time table?
Maintenance;Are you saying there's actually a car out there
Maintenance;But not every car that starts at C would do that?
Maintenance;Did it saythat?
Maintenance;How do you report the final results?
Maintenance;I understand what you mean
Maintenance;I'm sorry
Maintenance;probably need to talk to Professor E alittle more about that.
Maintenance;put it up there.
Maintenance;right
Maintenance;right
Maintenance;right
Maintenance;Right
Maintenance;right
Maintenance;right
Maintenance;right
Maintenance;So it has four approaches at most?
Maintenance;So you want to leave one of these constant and change theother.
Maintenance;This is cars?
Maintenance;Want to draw something?
Maintenance;What I would do is
Maintenance;you can buildmultiple simulations on this map
Maintenance;You know?
Maintenance;you know?
Maintenance;you say, I want 50 cars like this.
Maintenance;you think?
Mediate;How much longer?
Mediate;so that's okay?
Mediate;Yeah, they're there. There's something about the light, eachlight has some kind of timing settings.
Motivate;And it's a very kind of recursive problem
Motivate;Definitely
Motivate;I wouldn't want
Motivate;If I move this, how does it change this
Motivate;It's nice in the simulation to be able to watch what'sgoing on here
Motivate;Oh right, so they could be different
Motivate;On this map.
Motivate;that would be very awkward
Motivate;That's true
Motivate;That's what I was going to say, yeah
Motivate;That's what I was saying
Motivate;When Jim is present, only Jim does the board, as you see hishand?writing, his ability to use markers is remarkable, so noone approaches the board, he's very good.
Notation Decision;ERdiagram
Notation Decision;I kind of want to build an ER diagram
Offer Alternative;Although
Offer Alternative;although wemight duplicate that down here so that they can keep track ofit
Offer Alternative;And what kind of metrics or ideas does she have aroundsuccess or failure of a given, of a simulation
Offer Alternative;ayout on here well I definitely want itred for this whole period, and definitely red while it's yellow,and then there should be a little bit of an overlap. Maybesomething tha
Offer Alternative;but I think
Offer Alternative;but the thing is
Offer Alternative;Cars are independent ofintersections I feel
Offer Alternative;each approach has a different light, or we could putthem in pairs where the north and south approaches both havethe same light signals.
Offer Alternative;I'm saying
Offer Alternative;Or
Offer Alternative;Or
Offer Alternative;or
Offer Alternative;or
Offer Alternative;or
Offer Alternative;or
Offer Alternative;Or
Offer Alternative;Or
Offer Alternative;or
Offer Alternative;Or
Offer Alternative;Or
Offer Alternative;Or
Offer Alternative;or
Offer Alternative;or
Offer Alternative;Or maybe allow cycleable defaults
Offer Alternative;or, again we could
Offer Alternative;Or, it could be you can drawwhile you're simulating.
Offer Alternative;So maybe that's a separate setting.
Offer Alternative;Well, by controlling it at an individual car level you end upcontrolling the flow
Offer Alternative;you have to have green arrow and red arrow
Opinion;Are north and south the same?
Opinion;by default it either hasor doesn't have a left?hand turn, right?
Opinion;constant speed throughout?
Opinion;do youmeasure that something worked or didn't
Opinion;how do you visualize that?
Opinion;howdo you detect that
Opinion;Like should we make itreally easy for them to set up a whole street's worth of trafficlights, so they're timed in sequence so that it's easy for trafficto flow through, or does that kind of defeat the purpose of theexercise for the students because
Opinion;o what would be an easy way to name each leg? So Iguess it's likeó
Opinion;So we are assuming
Opinion;That's the thing, are the speeds to beassumed
Opinion;what does that mean
Opinion;you know

Rephrase;So there's lik
Rephrase;So, like yousaid, if you click on here and double click on here then there'ssome form that lets you collect the information about thatintersection.
Request;, this would be visible

Request;But what constitutes a well?movingtraffic
Request;But what does the intersection, what is the purpose of theintersection in life
Request;by default it either hasor doesn't have a left?hand turn, right?
Request;constant speed throughout?
Request;distances, and density relate to it?
Request;do youmeasure that something worked or didn't

Request;what does that mean
Request;what does that mean?
Request;What else are we going to be drawing?
Request;Where was the part where there was something about waittime
Request;you know
Request;You want to?
Request Confirmation;And this is a real?time table?
Request Confirmation;Are you saying there's actually a car out there

Request Confirmation;Right
Request Confirmation;right
Request Confirmation;right
Request Confirmation;right
Request Confirmation;right
Request Confirmation;right
Request Confirmation;right
Request Confirmation;So it has four approaches at most?
Request Confirmation;So you want to leave one of these constant and change theother.
Request Confirmation;This is cars?
Request Confirmation;you can buildmultiple simulations on this map
Request Confirmation;You know?
Request Confirmation;you know?
Request Confirmation;you say, I want 50 cars like this.
Request Confirmation;you think?
Request Focus Change;Here
Request Focus Change;It's messier than usual whiteboards.
Request Focus Change;Lets see, lets see
Request Focus Change;then cars
Request Focus Change;Well and I can also see how, in either case
Request Focus Change;Well, I was going to leave the arrow out fo
Request Focus Change;Yeah, I feel like this stuff over here
Scoping;This is part of the simulation
Structural Decision;additional information on each intersection
Structural Decision;And each approach has a set of lights
Structural Decision;are four lights in an intersection
Structural Decision;cars always on the road,and sometimes in intersection. And the intersection tells thecar what it can or cannot do at any given time. And the carneeds to tell the intersection what it wants to do. So the carknows what it wants to do, where it's going and 
Structural Decision;has a configuration of how long it's on,and each approach has whether it has a sensor, and eachapproach has a left?signal
Structural Decision;I mean, we've got a lot of individual components,but we hadn't really talked about like, we talked a little bitabout the interaction, 
Structural Decision;individual ones
Structural Decision;instances of these things are when we were runthe simulation
Structural Decision;intersection has the complete
Structural Decision;intersection, which has all theplayers to it. And then, I don't know that it has left?hand turns.Each intersection has approaches.
Structural Decision;larger object
Structural Decision;optionally
Structural Decision;road, it has a name, and has a direction, northsouth east west or maybe an angle, 90 degree to 180 yeah, hasa starting point, ending point, from which you calculate thedistance
Structural Decision;simulation configuration can give the map, theintersection, and the traffic pattern
Structural Decision;Simulation configuration has a map
Structural Decision;simulation road
Structural Decision;So there is arelationship between the road, very dynamic relationship,between the car, the road, and the intersection
Structural Decision;there are also the cars
Structural Decision;We can savemultiple maps and each map has many roads
Structural Decision;What does intersection give you, and what can I tell theintersection? So I can tell the intersection how it's configured,you know.
Structural Decision;Your map is a namedobject, your intersection configuration is a named object, andyour traffic patterns are named object
Suggest; we'll say you should getstarted on this much, we need to go and clarify this withProfessor E

Summarize Information;didn't get to the sensors at all
Summarize Information;have up to six intersections.
Summarize Information;I told you the streets, intersections,left and right, I told you traffic patterns, you figure out what thelights are. 
Summarize Information;It said we can figure that out.
Summarize Information;Oh okay, in the idealcase, the amount of time people spend waiting is minimized bythe chosen settings for the given intersection's traffic lights.
Summarize Information;okay we've assigned speeds,we've moved the roads, we draw the roads, inspectintersections and lights, okay
Summarize Information;Okay, create visual map, clean up roads and pattern ofchoosing...
Summarize Information;so one is you want to change the layout of the map, two isyou want to change the parameters you gave us in terms ofspeed and timing, right? And three, you want to run it,
Summarize Information;So that's what I'm saying this is very very highlevel, this is kind of go and build a map, but there is so manyvariables here that would be very hard ahead of time to naildown unless you actually started doing it, and it would be avery iterative process, because you change this thing, and thatchanges something that, you know that changes, it's all veryrelated.
Summarize Information;So you have green, red, left?turn, and orange
Summarize Information;that's kind of where this stuff lives
Summarize Information;the students are going to realize at some point I think,its probably part of the exercise is the professor wants them to,is that you really want your sequences on a given street tofollow a given pattern that enables traffic flow withoutspeeding, and to actually manually enter all that information ishuge
Summarize Information;Then we got street and density possibly speeds
Summarize Information;well we've got the visual map of the area
Summarize Information;Well, I mean so the end users seem to be the students, and theprofessor.
Summarize Information;You can only change lights, youcan't change the streets
Suppose;, if you click on here and double click on here then there'ssome form that
Suppose;f south has a green arrow, then
Suppose;if
Suppose;if
Suppose;if
Suppose;If
Suppose;if
Suppose;if
Suppose;If
Suppose;if
Suppose;if
Suppose;if the speed on this street is25mph, adding relay, how long should it take you to go thisdistance
Suppose;if this is green, then y
Suppose;if we had alittle more time
Suppose;if you want tosimulate it, you have to know
Suppose;then
Suppose;youhave the instance of the car, the car knows where it's going. Sothe car comes, and does some sort of hand?shaking with theroad and the road knows it has this 
Task;And it says there is some package that has some understandingof how speeds
Task;basically we have three differentóthere's editing themap, building the map is one mode. And then there's buildingthe simulation betweenóand we could use the map too
Task;But we don't have enoughinformation here. There might be packages out there
Task;didn't get to the sensors at all
Task;does the professor want the students to learn that through trialand error
Task;goal is that as many cars are moving at any given time asclose to speed limit as possible
Task;have up to six intersections.
Task;Here
Task;his is always the point where I'm scared toerase the board. We need to take a picture of that.
Task;I told you the streets, intersections,left and right, I told you traffic patterns, you figure out what thelights are. 
Task;It said we can figure that out.
Task;it's kind of like I go back, like what is exactly theoutput, you kno
Task;It's messier than usual whiteboards.
Task;Letme erase over here. It's this stuff that I'm worried about. It'skind of sketchy.
Task;Lets assume this, lets assume it's inside a city so...
Task;Lets see, lets see
Task;Oh okay, in the idealcase, the amount of time people spend waiting is minimized bythe chosen settings for the given intersection's traffic lights.
Task;okay we've assigned speeds,we've moved the roads, we draw the roads, inspectintersections and lights, okay
Task;Okay, create visual map, clean up roads and pattern ofchoosing...
Task;so one is you want to change the layout of the map, two isyou want to change the parameters you gave us in terms ofspeed and timing, right? And three, you want to run it,
Task;So that's what I'm saying this is very very highlevel, this is kind of go and build a map, but there is so manyvariables here that would be very hard ahead of time to naildown unless you actually started doing it, and it would be avery iterative process, because you change this thing, and thatchanges something that, you know that changes, it's all veryrelated.
Task;So you have green, red, left?turn, and orange
Task;summarize the unclaritiesthat we had for Professor E
Task;that's kind of where this stuff lives
Task;the students are going to realize at some point I think,its probably part of the exercise is the professor wants them to,is that you really want your sequences on a given street tofollow a given pattern that enables traffic flow withoutspeeding, and to actually manually enter all that information ishuge
Task;then cars
Task;Then we got street and density possibly speeds
Task;This is something where I'd go back to the customer and tryand figure out
Task;This is when I pull out my camera
Task;This is why we need to check with theprofessor again
Task;Well and I can also see how, in either case
Task;well we've got the visual map of the area
Task;Well, I mean so the end users seem to be the students, and theprofessor.
Task;Well, I was going to leave the arrow out fo
Task;where are you drawing
Task;Yeah, I feel like this stuff over here
Task;You can only change lights, youcan't change the streets
Technical Decision;o I guess we couldhave some prefabricated for them.
Usability and User Interface;And then as those thingschange during the simulationówell as they move things theycan see how the distance changed, and you can see the time ittakes to travel at a given speed
Usability and User Interface;big?assdialogue
Usability and User Interface;But I'm saying that can get very
Usability and User Interface;but once you've done it, it's still here
Usability and User Interface;cannot be a web application
Usability and User Interface;click on here and double click
Usability and User Interface;color the road bolder
Usability and User Interface;continue to use the same colorshere to associate with traffic lights
Usability and User Interface;dashboard
Usability and User Interface;do I want todo pairs of four different.
Usability and User Interface;epresent things in what, seconds
Usability and User Interface;"flexible but easy; easy to fill outfor a simple case and flexible enough that you could make itpretty complicated"
Usability and User Interface;go back into this mode tochange things.
Usability and User Interface;havepallets
Usability and User Interface;hen for a given intersection ifyou select the intersection then there has to be some tool downhere for editing
Usability and User Interface;here is a whole sort of a dialogue for configuring carsand cars' behavior
Usability and User Interface;hese numbers would be changing
Usability and User Interface;I mean we could list each intersectiondown but in some ways it's kind of a cross?table. Like, if I putstreets this way and avenues this way,
Usability and User Interface;I think that
Usability and User Interface;it can kind of just become some kind of mover here
Usability and User Interface;it wouldn't scale very well if you added a lot of streets.
Usability and User Interface;itwould be nice to enable them to copy the settings from oneonto another one
Usability and User Interface;justputting in numbers
Usability and User Interface;kind of a table of results
Usability and User Interface;"Like how many drawingtools, you can multi?select and you can make them the same;same width, same height."
Usability and User Interface;Like if you click on thisintersection, you can specify all the information about thelights, but because during the simulation you're not going towant all that detail there because it's just going to beoverwhelming in addition to seeing the traffic so its nice tohave this as kind of a summary of what you've set up so youcan refer to that, and also maybe to let you edit it over hererather than here.
Usability and User Interface;like we said it could be bold whenthere's traffic there, smaller
Usability and User Interface;little pop?ups
Usability and User Interface;maximum number of cars is actuallygetting backed up to the last intersection, like that's a hugewarning problem
Usability and User Interface;meaninglittle dots are moving, showing you how the traffic is flowing
Usability and User Interface;most you're going to have four of thos
Usability and User Interface;nd fill it in, or it'sjust a table
Usability and User Interface;nowyou pull down the menu, or this is where the summary table is
Usability and User Interface;o is I'd put a red here to say that they'restopped, like this, and then I would, and since green means go,I would just use an arrow like this to say traffic is going in thatdirection.
Usability and User Interface;o should be i
Usability and User Interface;ou need direction, south.Where they're going, start, end, where they want to end
Usability and User Interface;popupwindow anymore
Usability and User Interface;present it to the user
Usability and User Interface;represents green arrow if weneed to
Usability and User Interface;reset button
Usability and User Interface;saidwe've got a pallet of roads
Usability and User Interface;select this intersection
Usability and User Interface;show them what the distance is her
Usability and User Interface;show up when you'redragging
Usability and User Interface;So I think we've gotóthey can lay this out. And they can movestuff around.
Usability and User Interface;So I'd imagine onceyou drew this grid something would generate automatically,and give you a way to fill in these details for each.
Usability and User Interface;So somehow you clickhere, I should be able to get highlights this and get somefeedback and have it selected because it can get kind of weird
Usability and User Interface;so that's density right here, and we've got distance bymoving this around,
Usability and User Interface;So then there's theófor each approach
Usability and User Interface;so very quickly you cancreate something without fussing with it too much, and bydefault it has to assumeó
Usability and User Interface;So we assume they have some sort of a pallet here where theygrab a road and they start dragging and then they drag that, sothere is some sort of drawing pallet right, that says okay I havethis thing I drag something, I'm drawing a road and I call itsomething and I draw and I call it B and I draw my roads andthen.
Usability and User Interface;some kind of table
Usability and User Interface;somedials
Usability and User Interface;somehow it has to be very interactive
Usability and User Interface;somehow lay it outin a grid
Usability and User Interface;something more shows up
Usability and User Interface;summary area
Usability and User Interface;that has littledots moving
Usability and User Interface;that's going to have to be labeled in blocks
Usability and User Interface;the [inaudible]
Usability and User Interface;there should be a car out
Usability and User Interface;There's kind of a drawing area here,
Usability and User Interface;thermometerlike
Usability and User Interface;they need a way to enter numbers
Usability and User Interface;this is what you can control
Usability and User Interface;this out of the box with all defaults
Usability and User Interface;This was thedensity, and then this was the turning percentages
Usability and User Interface;This, we'll just put orange around it,
Usability and User Interface;Thisis kind of the editing?setting mode, and then for each road, youcan specify the density: how many cars per minute, hour, aretraveling through.
Usability and User Interface;timeline is probably useful in combination withnumber
Usability and User Interface;to keep it easy we'll justautomatically label them
Usability and User Interface;traffic lights, this iswhere it'd kind of difficult
Usability and User Interface;visualization of the map
Usability and User Interface;visualize thatsimulation
Usability and User Interface;visualize the overlap of the red and green
Usability and User Interface;We need to put that cursor hereand move this around, and then we're going to show that thesegment distance as movement.
Usability and User Interface;where you specify whether there's left?turns or no
Usability and User Interface;you can at least change this
Usability and User Interface;you'd also have to see the numbers somewhere
Usability and User Interface;you'redragging
Use Case;And then you can specify it
Use Case;can look at it the next dayand say that was a crappy simulation
Use Case;car starting at A that wants to end upon the diagonal of, you know, D
Use Case;choose a road
Use Case;don't know if they can set thespeeds
Use Case;editing
Use Case;green staysóyouhave to say how long green stays o
Use Case;hen the user draws these.
Use Case;how do you sort of do the root cause analysisof which intersection it is, because this one appears to be abottleneck
Use Case;I wantto use this map, with this intersections, with these trafficpatterns.
Use Case;If cars are just dots andyou see them moving, how can you draw conclusions thenfrom what you're seeing
Use Case;If we want to let them control itat that level. So then, like at the corner of A and 1st, there's anorth approach, and A and 1st, heres the south approach. Aand 1st east and west. And then with that, you can say 'is therea separate left hand signal? Is there a sensor?'
Use Case;if you click on thisintersection
Use Case;in other words soyou can customize your car
Use Case;in viewing, like thesimulation would be so hard for the students to set u
Use Case;okay run the simulation for twominutes, three minutes
Use Case;Okay, so that's another thing we want to be able to specify indrawing.
Use Case;ou can reuse the map andrun various simulations through i
Use Case;ow you'd figure out like what percentageof cars are turning left.
Use Case;say between these hours, 50cars start at B and then given the percentages, they're going toturn at 9am.
Use Case;So it's like a drawing tool that can allow them to lay downthese intersections
Use Case;So the user can changewhere the intersections are, the distance between them bymoving them around, they can change the speed, and thedensity of any given street up here.
Use Case;So the user is dragging, drawing these things, placingintersections, and now they have this grid
Use Case;So you build your roads and you build all of that, and you'vegot your distances and your speeds and all of that.
Use Case;So you ran thesimulation, so you see some visual on the grid, you see a tableunderneath, giving you some averages, you possibly have somedials which you can touch, you know, while it's happening
Use Case;Sofor example, you run it, and you find out that for two minutes,the traffic moved really fast and then they got to theintersection of C and 2nd and there was a bottleneck
Use Case;students in each intersection
Use Case;Students need to be able to build
Use Case;the professor says,you know, during these hours this is what the traffic pattern islike just enter into the system, its almost a characteristic of thisduring certain hours
Use Case;Thestudent has to be able to say, this intersection does have lefthandturns.
Use Case;They can set the density.
Use Case;this traffic increases
Use Case;traffic speed throughout.
Use Case;What are the metrics that I'mtrying to think of that you measure that this lighting system isworking well?
Use Case;What is your desire, what is tolerable?
Use Case;when you're drawingsomething new you automatically getóthis is what thedefaults are going to be for new intersections and then you goand change them later.
Use Case;you build the streets
Use Case;you buildthe simulation, you run it in which you use this map and thenwe have a graphic way of showing where all the traffic isbacking up
Use Case;you can mix and match.
Use Case;you can start building complexities into the cars,into the traffic.
Use Case;You could specify the density for the traffic comingin at each road.
Use Case;You want to prove to the professor that you put together asimulation that actually met her criteria
Use Case;you wouldn't really enter them

Acknowledge;Yeah, that makes sense

Acknowledge;Yeah, that's it
Acknowledge;Yeah, yeah.
Acknowledge;Yeah, yeah.
Acknowledge;Yeah.
Acknowledge;Yeah. I'm pretty sure
Acknowledge;yeah. Okay cool
Acknowledge;Yep.
Acknowledge;Yes, exactly
Agree;It think so. Yeah, I agree.
Agree;Yeah, because it could you know
Argue; but also at eachintersection you can say this percentage is going to do this forvarying reasons that we don't
Argue; I see the big picture, but I don't know the intersections
Argue; if it doesn't have a sensor it just assumes, justignores the poll
Argue; if we continue the hierarchy of the signals, the rules
Argue; if you envisioned some sort of[inaudible] package then there'd be sort of this thing you knowthey'd drop a leftÇ-turn signal in there, and a straight signal
Argue; if you have a light dictating left, it's always goingto be a left turn and straight and more often
Argue; So this is the left turnlane
Argue;, I'm not sure
Argue;. And so you find this flow which islike,
Argue;Actually I [inaudible] should either.
Argue;Actually it doesn't require them to save it actually.So theoretically it's all good memory.
Argue;and so can you hit 
Argue;And so instead of going from intersection 
Argue;And so this guy has this loop, this Do Sim loop,and these are kind of the drivers of the system
Argue;And so we think about, termination of, do we get flow out of thissystem, do we think about
Argue;basically this needs tomodel a set of use cases. 
Argue;But at 
Argue;but do we really want to stopthe number of cars it keeps queuing up
Argue;but I don't know 
Argue;but I'm
Argue;but lengthis 
Argue;But then do you have to specifyoutput points?
Argue;But then this 
Argue;but we may need to trackÇ-we may need toset up outputs you know
Argue;but what would the outputs necessarily be of that
Argue;But, I think
Argue;Butthen there's 
Argue;butthis can be dictated 
Argue;Do the roads delegate this, or do the intersections delegate all thecommunication
Argue;does it run on a clock or does 
Argue;I don't [inaudible] into it.
Argue;I don't think we need to make assumption of lanes, period
Argue;if it blocks, the queue tells it hey I'mfull, that thread has to stop you know and then it's got to pull it tomake it go again
Argue;if some carhere is wanting to go straight and this is backed up, they cannot
Argue;if the queue is empty on the road, don't trigger it green
Argue;if theres a one way road, so basically there's only one endpoint on this road
Argue;If theres no traffic
Argue;if there's no traffic, neverturn it green.
Argue;if this road fills up, it's going to have to know I'm full, I can'taccept anymore traffic coming down my way.
Argue;if we just say has the car,and then the rules come in here whether it's sensored or nonsensored.
Argue;If we make the assumption that we're not going to have so a twolaneroad that turns into a oneÇ-lane road, I think we're fineÇ-
Argue;if we think about, you know,somebody is going to say start feeding cars in here, and then thisguy has to say hey I'm full, stop
Argue;if you have one lane, you don't really run intoreality 
Argue;if you're going to get back up here youcould potentially back it up into the next intersection dependingon this length here which is going to 
Argue;If you'renot, if you don't want a sensor, they said they can have withoutsensors, then it's completely time based.
Argue;If youthink of this as kind of an encapsulated entity then it's not goingto know about this.
Argue;ifyou have a full lane everywhere in the intersection so everythingfits they're two lanes at that point.
Argue;I'm not sure
Argue;I'm not sure. 
Argue;I'm still wondering about the leftÇ-turn lane.
Argue;Is it a push or a pull model with the intersections
Argue;It think so. Yeah, I agree.
Argue;it's getting down to push or pull
Argue;It's just a green but
Argue;mean if you think of, you know desktop or 
Argue;mean if you think of, you know desktop or 
Argue;one signal perdirection at each intersection. Could be 
Argue;Or do we just assume that anything doesn'thaveÇ-
Argue;or intersection is going tohave to say something. Okay, cars can come, and then the roadsare going to have to
Argue;Or is thatÇ-
Argue;Or is this thetime between state changes
Argue;or, I'mgoing to have a left 
Argue;Other option is to make it a full two second lane
Argue;Put them in, or pull them out
Argue;sense to me or just basically 
Argue;So a lane has a signal, you know just kind of abstract.
Argue;So basically each entry into the intersection there's going to be nnumber of signals
Argue;So basically intersection is going to say to this road, you know R1,R2, R3, R4
Argue;So basically leftor straight depending on the car.
Argue;So basically there would be a queue 
Argue;So basically we need an option to say
Argue;So each road is going 
Argue;So how are these signals
Argue;so howÇ-what is the behavior of the inputs andwould there be any requirements on that? 
Argue;So I have a leftÇ-turn lane
Argue;so I mean at that 
Argue;So I think 
Argue;so I think one of the things we'recoming out is the roadÇ-I don't know if it has lanes so much as ithas, you know left, straight, right
Argue;So I think we 
Argue;So I would 
Argue;so if an intersection has a sensor, thenÇ-I think is that assimple as this intersection having API with the road calls? 
Argue;So if the 
Argue;So if we 
Argue;So in terms of software 
Argue;so it depends
Argue;So it seems like they're designing 
Argue;So it sounds like the intersection needs to basically grab from thisroad to whatever connected road it needs to go. 
Argue;so let's get into that.
Argue;So let's go with the minimum so
Argue;So our intersectionsÇ-so it seems like our real thing isÇ-now
Argue;So roads is the means by traffic gets to each individualintersection so we have to have a connection ofÇ-the intersectionhave to be connected in some way. So that the roads would beour connection points
Argue;so that if 
Argue;So that way the road 
Argue;so that's another 
Argue;So the 
Argue;So the big rocks we're putting in the jar are
Argue;So there's 
Argue;So there's this protected left
Argue;So there's this, this relationship here. Each road connects to twointersections
Argue;So this is really all the editing someone's 
Argue;So this road ends into one of its endpoints is an intersection
Argue;So this, I think, is the model on which to build the end userapplication.
Argue;so timing
Argue;So to keep it moving
Argue;So we definitely have
Argue;So we have a model 
Argue;so we have this behavior 
Argue;So we kind
Argue;So we want simple
Argue;So we've got kind of this,
Argue;So what are the aspects of the speed that are important?
Argue;so which ones do 
Argue;So you 
Argue;So you just haverotating green, yellow, red
Argue;So you've got an input
Argue;so, we need aprotected left
Argue;so. We can think 
Argue;this has a length, it never overflows, you know iften, five cars can fit then it's all
Argue;Yeah, because it could you know
Argue;you follow thepercentage model then we can just calculate what that wouldmean for the entry source of cars coming in.
Argue;You know, or input
Assumption; could have a pileÇ-upeffect
Assumption; I thinkwe just go off the number of signals at each intersection. The onlything the lanes are really going to affect is...how the lights affectus
Assumption; I'd imagine some guy turning on afaucet. When the sink's full, turn it off, let it drain down, or tellme there's more room I'll turn it on again
Assumption; if you envisioned some sort of[inaudible] package then there'd be sort of this thing you knowthey'd drop a leftÇ-turn signal in there, and a straight signal
Assumption; if you have a light dictating left, it's always goingto be a left turn and straight and more often
Assumption; I'm not sure if those are the same as signals
Assumption;" It's one of those things like... Imean from the [inaudible] perspective right makes sense, butfrom reality putting right there doesn't make sense becausestraight, depending unless you're going to have an explicit rightturn lane, straight is going to have to worry about rights as well;they're in the same queue essentially. I'll just put right there Iguess."
Assumption; seems like our real thing isÇ-now areroads 
Assumption; The intersection needs to say that only oneÇ-onlysafe ones go on at a time so 
Assumption; the roads have a length butthis can be dictated by the number of signals at each intersection.
Assumption;, I mean it just consists of a set of intersectionsconnected by roads so.
Assumption;Actually it doesn't require them to save it actually.So theoretically it's all good memory.
Assumption;And is this lengthsignificant to store the number of cars
Assumption;And so there's a main map controllerand just kind of brainstorming here
Assumption;And so this guy has this loop, this Do Sim loop,and these are kind of the drivers of the system
Assumption;And so you find this flow which islike, you know two cars per, one car per ten seconds orsomething into this road
Assumption;"And that's a small part of what I'm saying is every car is just thesame; same length"
Assumption;And then each signal's going to have a certainrule set to them
Assumption;And then how many cars arestacked up, which is going to be a method of, which is really thelength is what we care. Not so much length we care about, weactually care about the number of cars piled up
Assumption;And then the intersection essentially theroad wants to know
Assumption;and then there's also theÇ-well there's time at the signal,and then there's just shear travel time down the street. Justmoving from point A to point B is going to take time
Assumption;and then you just have dictate people waiting for that turnare going to pile up as if it was straight
Assumption;assuming these are correlated
Assumption;at that point then we care about length a littlebit just for shear travel time
Assumption;Because at that point the rules more apply to the intersectionitself as opposed to any one individual signal
Assumption;because if there's a leftÇ-turn light, and they have straight light, aprotected left
Assumption;Because one lane isalways going, is always continuing through so if this is down toone lane you'd have one lane going straight, one lane feeding intothe leftÇ-hand turn, which is I mean I think it's fine
Assumption;because they should have two way traffic going betweentwoÇ-way intersections
Assumption;Because this road is filling up,its queue is filling up, and it needs to drain
Assumption;can choose you know is it just a straight or, I'mgoing to have a left turn and then initially
Assumption;Direction. Left, Straight
Assumption;Do we want to assume one lane of traffic coming in
Assumption;does it run on a clock or does it run, you knowhow do you control 
Assumption;Don't worryabout turning in, just have a full second lane here so that wehaveÇ-that way we don't have that whole trying to figure out howwhat that length considered to the other part of the lane is and ifyou have a full lane everywhere in the intersection so everythingfits they're two lanes at that point.
Assumption;each road is going to have two end points
Assumption;Except cars speed up
Assumption;Feel free to jump in. We've got signals, we've got roads,we've got cars, and now 
Assumption;given a certain road youcan have different lanes leading up to each intersection,
Assumption;have what rules attached to thisto make a car go, not go
Assumption;I could see a situation where you want to justÇ-you have Xnumber of cars queued up, you say I'm going to stop this for nowbut you still want that throughÇ-put to go through even though ithasn't necessarily hit this intersection yet
Assumption;I mean areroads saying, can I go? Can I go? Or are the intersectionsÇ-shouldthe intersection tell the road, you know, flow you know five cars.
Assumption;I mean they're also going to say fifty percent make a left, fiftypercent go straight in each scenario.
Assumption;I mean this guy is going to have certain properties by itself too
Assumption;I think it's more of a collection of signals because
Assumption;I think there's aÇ-should be [inaudible] this if not just two fulllanes
Assumption;I want to put right 
Assumption;if it blocks, the queue tells it hey I'mfull, that thread has to stop you know and then it's got to pull it tomake it go again
Assumption;if some carhere is wanting to go straight and this is backed up, they cannot
Assumption;if this road fills up, it's going to have to know I'm full, I can'taccept anymore traffic coming down my way.
Assumption;If we make the assumption that we're not going to have so a twolaneroad that turns into a oneÇ-lane road, I think we're fineÇ-
Assumption;if you have one lane, you don't really run intoreality 
Assumption;if you're going to get back up here youcould potentially back it up into the next intersection dependingon this length here which is going to 
Assumption;If you'renot, if you don't want a sensor, they said they can have withoutsensors, then it's completely time based.
Assumption;If youthink of this as kind of an encapsulated entity then it's not goingto know about this.
Assumption;I'm assuming we'd probably have to do that.
Assumption;I'm trying to think, what would road call necessarily tointersection to say let one car throughÇ-
Assumption;intersection has a sensor, thenÇ-I think is that assimple as this intersection having API with the road calls? Thenit's up to the intersection to sayÇ-
Assumption;is basically you have a source justpoint of traffic. Cars are coming in. 
Assumption;It sounds like more and more like the intersection is kind of[inaudible] 
Assumption;itfixed size as a subset of the lane 
Assumption;It's howmanyÇ-the number of cars that can flow through a light, or asignal. And so the signal has the properties on signal is this timehere and that time is going to you know cars
Assumption;it's more of a stops. It's more of a stops flow starts flow kindof thing.
Assumption;Itseems like there's a modeling engine
Assumption;Kind of seems more like a [inaudible] map
Assumption;Lanes seem like a complexity we don't want to get into
Assumption;Number of cars
Assumption;One of those where it's kind of one lane and then you havethe option of going in there to you have a protected left and thishas a certain distance
Assumption;Or do we just assume that anything doesn'thaveÇ-
Assumption;Other option is to make it a full two second lane
Assumption;Put this signal here
Assumption;Roads have lanes and lanes have signals so then we make theassumption
Assumption;SensorÇ-driven
Assumption;Simulate a three way
Assumption;So a lane has a signal, you know just kind of abstract.
Assumption;So basically intersection is going to say to this road, you know R1,R2, R3, R4
Assumption;So how do you share that informationacross all the signals.
Assumption;So if we continue the hierarchy of the signals, the rules. There'stime
Assumption;So roads is the means by traffic gets to each individualintersection so we have to have a connection ofÇ-the intersectionhave to be connected in some way. So that the roads would beour connection points
Assumption;So we can sort of start with the hierarchy: intersections seem tohave signals. N of those. Roads have lanes
Assumption;so what does the leftÇ-hand turn reallymean though, it's just anotherÇ-you're just basically turning fromintersection to intersection no matter what we do at this point
Assumption;the leftcan go at the same time and then
Assumption;the number of cars in period of time
Assumption;the road would actually own what traffic it expects tobe traveling on it
Assumption;the signals at thatindividual intersection
Assumption;thecars need to know how fast they can actually move with othercars in front 
Assumption;there's a flow, there's a flow of T over some function of time
Assumption;There's at least one signalÇ-there's at least one signal perdirection at each intersection. Could be multiple, especially withthe leftÇ-hand turn requirement.
Assumption;There's going to be aninput and there's actually going to be an output track wherethings are just going to go out to space. 
Assumption;There's two things: there's no traffic with asensor would mean that there's no, you're never green.
Assumption;These cars have a signal there, these cars have a signalthere, and of course these have a signal. And the leftÇ-hand, thiskind of implies
Assumption;they need to be organized in some way
Assumption;they're not going to disappear into a void I mean we'renotÇ-its not necessarily a closed system
Assumption;thing is that the controls have to modify the signaltimings and the sensors so we basically got to just basically sayhere's
Assumption;think theintersection's going toÇ-basically its interface is looking at that,its going to say road give me left cars, give me straight cars, giveme right cars
Assumption;this has a length, it never overflows, you know iften, five cars can fit then it's all
Assumption;This is on the road isn't it? Not on the intersection
Assumption;to affect the complexity of the problem and 
Assumption;TwoÇ-two lanes? Is there a leftÇ-turn lane, or is it a suicide left?
Assumption;we canmake the assumption of just two lanes everywhere
Assumption;We could definitely make that an option,
Assumption;we kind of tinkering around with this realÇ-world model
Assumption;We might have multiple inputs and they're all going to have to sayhere's cars coming at you. And at that point the road justbecomes a queue and just keeps on popping on cars, and thenthey keep, they'll just pop off the queue.
Assumption;We might have to say add left caradd straight car, there might be more to the road I'm starting tothink.
Assumption;we think about, you know,somebody is going to say start feeding cars in here, and then thisguy has to say hey I'm full, stop.
Assumption;Well it's a queue with a limit
Assumption;We've gotcars, so there's a signal there
Assumption;whether itmakes sense to me or just basically just each road you would havebe able to toggle percentages to say this percent's going to make aleft, this percent is going straight, this percent going right. 
Assumption;With that model then, yeahthen we're going to have something which basically going to stopit when it gets full
Assumption;you follow thepercentage model then we can just calculate what that wouldmean for the entry source of cars coming in.
Assumption;You'vegot one straight lane. Then there's this dog leg that you can gointo like that, and then this has a length and a whole [inaudible
Behavioural Decision; And so the whole system it looks like to run a simulation,it's a multiÇ-threaded thing where this gets a thread, and this getsa thread, and this is just kind of a dummy
Behavioural Decision; if it doesn't have a sensor it just assumes, justignores the poll
Behavioural Decision;Add Car call for each road will just determinethe direction the car's going to take at its next path. [inaudible].Get a good distribution
Behavioural Decision;also going to be the some intersections where youwant that to turn green no matter what.
Behavioural Decision;And let's thinkabout who owns or controls that
Behavioural Decision;And then so the intersectionjust saysÇ-and then we said the road would specify whatpercentage wants to make a left, right, and that, and the add carcan just follow thatÇ-those rules
Behavioural Decision;Do the roads delegate this, or do the intersections delegate all thecommunication
Behavioural Decision;Does the road tell theintersection, hey I've got traffic. I was just kind of modeling itfrom the perspective of the sensor
Behavioural Decision;Has Car, and then the intersection, it's got a sensor just poll
Behavioural Decision;I mean if it's some type of random behavior then eventuallythe threads are just going to kick them off, 
Behavioural Decision;if the queue is empty on the road, don't trigger it green
Behavioural Decision;if we just say has the car,and then the rules come in here whether it's sensored or nonsensored.
Behavioural Decision;I'll put the rulesfor the signals. Signals have rules.
Behavioural Decision;It's going to go through the inputs, loop throughall the inputs, and fire start an add car thread for each input
Behavioural Decision;model of behavior where we have these cars turningleft, these stopped, these cars going straight, and then when thisstops these cars can then go
Behavioural Decision;So is itÇ-so does the road, a road needs to define the leftand the right so the intersections says R1 give me three left, youknow give me thirty seconds of left turners and then he addsthem to this
Behavioural Decision;So n number of cars make a left turn, nnumber of cars go straight, a car can make a right
Behavioural Decision;so there needs to be atoggle to say if this has a sensor thenÇ-if there's no traffic, neverturn it green
Behavioural Decision;That would be moreÇ-that would be the car. Thecar's responsibility I guess
Behavioural Decision;The intersection is going to say, okay my light isgreen, R1Ç-I mean it's green for thirty secondsÇ-R1 give me tencars, we can calculate that, and put them in R3.
Behavioural Decision;the leftcan go at the same time
Behavioural Decision;The problem is that they're going tohave toÇ-how do you coordinate that between all signals at eachintersection
Behavioural Decision;the rules
Behavioural Decision;There's the time between a red light turning greenÇ-or isthat just the time between all state changes
Behavioural Decision;this behavior wheresomebody has to synchronize these signals
Behavioural Decision;We could play withthat. Because these are the big state changes. Yellow has nodifference really
Behavioural Decision;You know, and then it's going to say for how long,and it calculates how many cars, and then it's going to add themto the queue in these other things.
Clarification;how do you coordinate that between all signals at eachintersection?
Clarification;Is it a push or a pull model with the intersections
Clarification;so howÇ-what is the behavior of the inputs andwould there be any requirements on that? 
Clarification;That's where I always liketo start. How do you see the code beingÇ-just kind of thestructure of it being broken down? 
Clarification;The only thing I'm kind of botheredis how do weÇ-how does this guy come into play in all of this?
Clarification;Would it add a car?
Conciliate;Actually I [inaudible] should either.
Coordinate Group Process; let's see what other data do we pull out
Coordinate Group Process;Call it a [inaudible] requirement. Cool. Let's check for anyother...
Coordinate Group Process;Concerned with too much detail before weevenÇ-otherwise we're going to cut stuff out.
Coordinate Group Process;I think we haveÇ-we can probably numerate the rules we'regoing to need too. 
Coordinate Group Process;I want to start by hearing your summary of this
Coordinate Group Process;let's dive into that a little bit.
Coordinate Group Process;let's explore that
Coordinate Group Process;let's put it in there and we'll capture that.
Coordinate Group Process;Let's take that oneout
Coordinate Group Process;So let's hide that detail. [inaudible]. 
Coordinate Group Process;start twoengineers on the model, one engineer on the UI. Get the modelgoing ahead. Cool.
Coordinate Group Process;The next step I would do is to 
Coordinate Group Process;We should model that
Data Decision;actually start coding up the datastructures themselves
Design Principle;to separate the UI off andwe want the underlying data structures and supporting things
Disagree;I don't [inaudible] into it.
Disagree;I don't think we need to make assumption of lanes, period
Doubt;, I'm not sure
Doubt;but I don't know 
Doubt;I'm not sure
Doubt;I'm not sure. 
Doubt;I'm still wondering about the leftÇ-turn lane.
Elaborate;also, I mean it seems
Elaborate;And it just tell them, hey full or heyI don't have any. So it's not it's own little thinking component.
Elaborate;and then test it, are you full? 
Elaborate;Aslong asÇ-also being able to control 
Elaborate;Imean it comes back to this whole problem that we were toyingwith. 
Elaboration;So in total?
Elaboration;The sensors?
Elaboration;What about it?
Encourage;Ahh that's brilliant
Encourage;Cool, cool. Sounds good
Encourage;Cool, I like that
Encourage;Excellent, excellent.
Encourage;Good question.
Encourage;I like that. Cool.
Encourage;Interesting
Encourage;That is a great point
Explain and Clarify; I mean, the roads have a length 
Explain and Clarify;I mean with that they havetwo intersections coming to four turn lanes, I mean that's theproblem
Explain and Clarify;I'mtrying to figure out how to capture the state of a car going down aspecific road
Explain and Clarify;Kind of the situation of how they are physically doesn't matter,we just more care about what's leading up to it, and what it'sleading off to.
Explain and Clarify;That's the real scenario
Explain and Clarify;What I'm wondering is that, is it one of thoseÇ-
Functionality; they're also going to say fifty percent make a left, fiftypercent go straight 
Functionality;I'm thinking thebox they're using they 
Functionality;Input is connected to a road and so he's going to tell the roadobject, 
Functionality;So this is really all the editing someone's going to need to playwith,
Functionality;there would be a queue for eachof these guys and then we'd say add a car. The road can decidehow you want paths.
Functionality;there's a function here that isÇ-what isthat? Start, run, do...do simulate
Functionality;to control the source amount of trafficcoming in
Functionality;we're going to have something which basically going to stopit when it gets full.
Implementation Decision;, I was kind of assuming simple DB here.
Implementation Decision;would need to be persistable.
Infer; So this is the left turnlane
Infer;. And so you find this flow which islike,
Infer;Actually it doesn't require them to save it actually.So theoretically it's all good memory.
Infer;and so can you hit 
Infer;And so instead of going from intersection 
Infer;And so this guy has this loop, this Do Sim loop,and these are kind of the drivers of the system
Infer;And so we think about, termination of, do we get flow out of thissystem, do we think about
Infer;basically this needs tomodel a set of use cases. 
Infer;So a lane has a signal, you know just kind of abstract.
Infer;So basically each entry into the intersection there's going to be nnumber of signals
Infer;So basically intersection is going to say to this road, you know R1,R2, R3, R4
Infer;So basically there would be a queue 
Infer;So basically we need an option to say
Infer;So each road is going 
Infer;So how are these signals
Infer;so howÇ-what is the behavior of the inputs andwould there be any requirements on that? 
Infer;So I have a leftÇ-turn lane
Infer;so I mean at that 
Infer;So I think 
Infer;so I think one of the things we'recoming out is the roadÇ-I don't know if it has lanes so much as ithas, you know left, straight, right
Infer;So I think we 
Infer;So I would 
Infer;So if the 
Infer;So if we 
Infer;So in terms of software 
Infer;so it depends
Infer;So it seems like they're designing 
Infer;So it sounds like the intersection needs to basically grab from thisroad to whatever connected road it needs to go. 
Infer;so let's get into that.
Infer;So let's go with the minimum so
Infer;So our intersectionsÇ-so it seems like our real thing isÇ-now
Infer;So roads is the means by traffic gets to each individualintersection so we have to have a connection ofÇ-the intersectionhave to be connected in some way. So that the roads would beour connection points
Infer;so that if 
Infer;So that way the road 
Infer;so that's another 
Infer;So the 
Infer;So the big rocks we're putting in the jar are
Infer;So there's 
Infer;So there's this protected left
Infer;So there's this, this relationship here. Each road connects to twointersections
Infer;So this is really all the editing someone's 
Infer;So this road ends into one of its endpoints is an intersection
Infer;So this, I think, is the model on which to build the end userapplication.
Infer;so timing
Infer;So to keep it moving
Infer;So we definitely have
Infer;So we have a model 
Infer;so we have this behavior 
Infer;So we kind
Infer;So we want simple
Infer;So we've got kind of this,
Infer;So what are the aspects of the speed that are important?
Infer;so which ones do 
Infer;So you 
Infer;So you just haverotating green, yellow, red
Infer;So you've got an input
Infer;so, we need aprotected left
Infer;so. We can think 
Inform; Because 
Inform; because I mean if you're going 
Inform; especially withthe leftÇ-hand turn requirement
Inform; I mean, the roads have a length 
Inform; I think, kind of the we would have to use[inaudible
Inform; I thinkwe just go off the number of signals at each intersection. 
Inform; know it stops, it stopsnecessarily adding cars to this road, 
Inform; let's see what other 
Inform; think one thing is that the controls have to modify the signaltimings and the sensors so we basically got to just basically sayhere's
Inform; think that at that point,we don't really care.
Inform; think there's another thing you captured here. There'sthese inputs. And the road can actually have or, you know.
Inform; think we can make that first clean division
Inform; think, is the model on which to build the end userapplication.
Inform;also, I mean it seems
Inform;And it just tell them, hey full or heyI don't have any. So it's not it's own little thinking component.
Inform;And it's significant because it holds anumber of cars.
Inform;and then test it, are you full? 
Inform;and then you just have dictate people waiting for that turnare going to pile up as if it was straight
Inform;Aslong asÇ-also being able to control 
Inform;Because all I'm saying it is, is basically you have a source 
Inform;Because at that point the rules more apply to the intersectionitself as opposed to any one individual signal
Inform;"because basically it's going to have given S1 goesgreen, it's going to have to delegate the actions of what S2 and S3are;"
Inform;because eachintersection is going to have four
Inform;Because I could see they'd want to clickthe 
Inform;Because I think really we care more about the signals at thatindividual intersection.
Inform;because if there's a leftÇ-turn light, and they have straight light, aprotected left
Inform;because if you have a light dictating left, it's always goingto be a left turn and straight and more often
Inform;because I'm coming back to this now, becausetechnically our queue is
Inform;because Imean you could eventually be taken off theÇ-once you leave theroad 
Inform;because Imean. There's a time element, because if the cars are stacking upat the intersection as opposed to free flowing in over twentyminutes.
Inform;because it holds anumber of cars.
Inform;Because it seems like there should be a 
Inform;Because it's really kind of thismeta
Inform;Because it'sgoing to have all the information it needs to know whether a carshould be continuing through or not
Inform;Because one lane isalways going, is always continuing through so if this is down toone lane you'd have one lane going straight, one lane feeding intothe leftÇ-hand turn, which is I mean I think it's fine
Inform;Because really all they're saying is to be able to change trafficdensity
Inform;because that is reallygoing to affect the complexity of the problem and so, 
Inform;Because thecars need to know how fast they can actually move with othercars in front of them.
Inform;Because thenyou have a way to connect up what each intersection connects upto and stuff.
Inform;Because there are two differenttimes. 
Inform;Because there's aÇ-yeah that's what I was trying to
Inform;Because they said you know they need to be able to control theinput coming in. okay.
Inform;because they should have two way traffic going betweentwoÇ-way intersections
Inform;Because this road is filling up,its queue is filling up, and it needs to drain
Inform;Because we canmake the assumption of just two lanes everywhere
Inform;Because, I mean, unless we care because given a certain road youcan have different lanes leading up to each intersection, it didn'treally 
Inform;becauseasÇ-if this road fills up, it's going to have to know I'm full
Inform;"becausestraight, depending unless you're going to have an explicit rightturn lane, straight is going to have to worry about rights as well;they're in the same queue essentially. I'll just put right there Iguess."
Inform;Direction. Left, Straight
Inform;I could see a situation where you want to justÇ-you have Xnumber of cars queued up, you say I'm going to stop this for nowbut you still want that throughÇ-put to go through even though ithasn't necessarily hit this intersection yet
Inform;I guess that dependency is really comes back to the signals
Inform;I guess the issues that are going to come into play are 
Inform;I mean with that they havetwo intersections coming to four turn lanes, I mean that's theproblem
Inform;I think 
Inform;I think it's a simplification
Inform;I think it's just more consistent 
Inform;I think it's more of a collection of signals because
Inform;I think its more of the number of cars in period of time
Inform;I think really we care more about 
Inform;I think that these are the only ones that should be toggable
Inform;I think the road's going to have to be a little bit smarter
Inform;I think theintersection's going toÇ-basically its interface is looking at that,its going to say road give me left cars, give me straight cars, giveme right cars
Inform;I think there's aÇ-should be [inaudible] this if not just two fulllanes
Inform;I think they're pretty straightÇ-forwardobjects
Inform;I think those were the main big players
Inform;I think we have
Inform;I'm saying this is probably the best assumption
Inform;I'm trying to think from how youwould actually manipulate this
Inform;Imean it comes back to this whole problem that we were toyingwith. 
Inform;Imean they can't make a left
Inform;I'mtrying to figure out how to capture the state of a car going down aspecific road
Inform;it just consists of a set of intersectionsconnected 
Inform;It seems like a, for this type of problem a good first attack is justkind of a, you know a data analysis
Inform;its going to be significant
Inform;It's kind of a combination of clock and then there's also[inaudible
Inform;It's two lanes, one of them
Inform;Just to get your thoughts.
Inform;Kind of a twice [inaudible
Inform;Kind of the situation of how they are physically doesn't matter,we just more care about what's leading up to it, and what it'sleading off to.
Inform;SensorÇ-driven
Inform;So how are these signalsÇ-trying to pull out our data
Inform;so I think one of the things we'recoming out is the roadÇ-I don't know if it has lanes so much as ithas, you know left, straight, right.
Inform;So it's interesting becausethe intersection has signals and the intersection has some controlof the signals. 
Inform;So let's go with the minimum so
Inform;so maybe the data structure is set up where we don'tcare, I don't think we do care
Inform;So we 
Inform;Sounds like at each individual lane. On top of that,and being able to basically control the amount of cars goingthrough and certain flows in certain areas.
Inform;That's the real scenario
Inform;That's why I'm trying tothink, the lanes aren't necessarily so important as whichintersection does it get you to next
Inform;The left turn really introduces a lot of problems
Inform;The onlything the lanes are really going to affect is...how the lights affectus
Inform;The problem is you can chop up lanes
Inform;the problem with that is the variable path.
Inform;the road would actually own what traffic it expects tobe traveling on it
Inform;the signals. Actual signals.
Inform;The traffic wants to know.
Inform;there's a time for each of those. tÇ-R, tÇ-Yellow, tÇ-Green
Inform;There'stime,
Inform;They have signals
Inform;Traffic
Inform;We can say IÇ-
Inform;We could play withthat. Because these are the big state changes. Yellow has nodifference really
Inform;we don't want to get into
Inform;we just more care about 
Inform;We might have multiple inputs and they're all going to have to sayhere's cars coming at you. And at that point the road justbecomes a queue and just keeps on popping on cars, and thenthey keep, they'll just pop off the queue.
Inform;We might have to say add left caradd straight car, there might be more to the road I'm starting tothink.
Inform;Well it's a queue with a limit
Inform;Well it's more of a stops. It's more of a stops flow starts flow kindof thing
Inform;What I'm wondering is that, is it one of thoseÇ-
Inform;Yeah I'm justÇ-do a flat file, sterilize it all
Inform;you know, the leftcan go at the same time and then.
Information;Does it say anything about the number of lanes?
Information;how do we?
Information;Is there a leftÇ-turn lane, or is it a suicide left?
Information;so nowcome back up, what big concepts haven't we captured yet
Information;what are we seeing here
Information;whatproperties of roads we have to worry about
Justify; Because 
Justify; because I mean if you're going 
Justify; especially withthe leftÇ-hand turn requirement
Justify;Because all I'm saying it is, is basically you have a source 
Justify;Because at that point the rules more apply to the intersectionitself as opposed to any one individual signal
Justify;"because basically it's going to have given S1 goesgreen, it's going to have to delegate the actions of what S2 and S3are;"
Justify;because eachintersection is going to have four
Justify;Because I could see they'd want to clickthe 
Justify;Because I think really we care more about the signals at thatindividual intersection.
Justify;because if there's a leftÇ-turn light, and they have straight light, aprotected left
Justify;because if you have a light dictating left, it's always goingto be a left turn and straight and more often
Justify;because I'm coming back to this now, becausetechnically our queue is
Justify;because Imean you could eventually be taken off theÇ-once you leave theroad 
Justify;because Imean. There's a time element, because if the cars are stacking upat the intersection as opposed to free flowing in over twentyminutes.
Justify;because it holds anumber of cars.
Justify;Because it seems like there should be a 
Justify;Because it's really kind of thismeta
Justify;Because it'sgoing to have all the information it needs to know whether a carshould be continuing through or not
Justify;Because one lane isalways going, is always continuing through so if this is down toone lane you'd have one lane going straight, one lane feeding intothe leftÇ-hand turn, which is I mean I think it's fine
Justify;Because really all they're saying is to be able to change trafficdensity
Justify;because that is reallygoing to affect the complexity of the problem and so, 
Justify;Because thecars need to know how fast they can actually move with othercars in front of them.
Justify;Because thenyou have a way to connect up what each intersection connects upto and stuff.
Justify;Because there are two differenttimes. 
Justify;Because there's aÇ-yeah that's what I was trying to
Justify;Because they said you know they need to be able to control theinput coming in. okay.
Justify;because they should have two way traffic going betweentwoÇ-way intersections
Justify;Because this road is filling up,its queue is filling up, and it needs to drain
Justify;Because we canmake the assumption of just two lanes everywhere
Justify;Because, I mean, unless we care because given a certain road youcan have different lanes leading up to each intersection, it didn'treally 
Justify;becauseasÇ-if this road fills up, it's going to have to know I'm full
Justify;"becausestraight, depending unless you're going to have an explicit rightturn lane, straight is going to have to worry about rights as well;they're in the same queue essentially. I'll just put right there Iguess."
Justify;Just to get your thoughts.
Justify;So it's interesting becausethe intersection has signals and the intersection has some controlof the signals. 
Justify;That's why I'm trying tothink, the lanes aren't necessarily so important as whichintersection does it get you to next
Justify;We could play withthat. Because these are the big state changes. Yellow has nodifference really
Lead; know it stops, it stopsnecessarily adding cars to this road, 
Lead; let's see what other 
Lead;And it's significant because it holds anumber of cars.
Lead;and then you just have dictate people waiting for that turnare going to pile up as if it was straight
Lead;Direction. Left, Straight
Lead;I could see a situation where you want to justÇ-you have Xnumber of cars queued up, you say I'm going to stop this for nowbut you still want that throughÇ-put to go through even though ithasn't necessarily hit this intersection yet
Lead;I'm trying to think from how youwould actually manipulate this
Lead;it just consists of a set of intersectionsconnected 
Lead;its going to be significant
Lead;It's kind of a combination of clock and then there's also[inaudible
Lead;It's two lanes, one of them
Lead;SensorÇ-driven
Lead;So how are these signalsÇ-trying to pull out our data
Lead;So we 
Lead;Sounds like at each individual lane. On top of that,and being able to basically control the amount of cars goingthrough and certain flows in certain areas.
Lead;The left turn really introduces a lot of problems
Lead;The onlything the lanes are really going to affect is...how the lights affectus
Lead;The problem is you can chop up lanes
Lead;the problem with that is the variable path.
Lead;the road would actually own what traffic it expects tobe traveling on it
Lead;the signals. Actual signals.
Lead;There'stime,
Lead;They have signals
Lead;Traffic
Lead;we don't want to get into
Lead;we just more care about 
Lead;We might have multiple inputs and they're all going to have to sayhere's cars coming at you. And at that point the road justbecomes a queue and just keeps on popping on cars, and thenthey keep, they'll just pop off the queue.
Lead;Well it's a queue with a limit
Lead;Well it's more of a stops. It's more of a stops flow starts flow kindof thing
Listening;I see
Maintenance;Do we care?
Maintenance;do we really want that
Maintenance;I see
Maintenance;is it safe from stuff like that
Maintenance;Is that really the only thing?
Maintenance;kind of? 
Maintenance;Really
Maintenance;right
Maintenance;so can you hit all the green
Maintenance;This is on the road isn't it
Maintenance;well?
Motivate; yeah that makes sense
Motivate;, that makes a lot of sense
Motivate;A queue with a limit
Motivate;Ahh that's brilliant
Motivate;because you're right
Motivate;Cool, cool. Sounds good
Motivate;Cool, I like that
Motivate;Exactly
Motivate;Exactly
Motivate;Exactly, exactly.
Motivate;Exactly, yeah exactly.
Motivate;Excellent, excellent.
Motivate;Good question.
Motivate;I like that. Cool.
Motivate;Interesting
Motivate;Interesting question
Motivate;It does, yeah
Motivate;Makes sense. 
Motivate;Right
Motivate;Sure, yeah, yeah.
Motivate;That fit, so
Motivate;That fit.
Motivate;That is a great point
Motivate;that makes sense
Motivate;That's interesting
Motivate;That's the perfect simplification.
Motivate;That's what I'm trying to figure out.
Motivate;Yeah, exactly.
Offer Alternative;Do the roads delegate this, or do the intersections delegate all thecommunication
Offer Alternative;does it run on a clock or does 
Offer Alternative;Is it a push or a pull model with the intersections
Offer Alternative;it's getting down to push or pull
Offer Alternative;mean if you think of, you know desktop or 
Offer Alternative;one signal perdirection at each intersection. Could be 
Offer Alternative;Or do we just assume that anything doesn'thaveÇ-
Offer Alternative;or intersection is going tohave to say something. Okay, cars can come, and then the roadsare going to have to
Offer Alternative;Or is thatÇ-
Offer Alternative;Or is this thetime between state changes
Offer Alternative;or, I'mgoing to have a left 
Offer Alternative;Other option is to make it a full two second lane
Offer Alternative;Put them in, or pull them out
Offer Alternative;sense to me or just basically 
Offer Alternative;So basically leftor straight depending on the car.
Offer Alternative;You know, or input
Opinion; does it run on a clock or does it run, you knowhow do you control this flow behavior?
Opinion; what does he tell the road object
Opinion;Ç-is this time for each one of these
Opinion;And is this lengthsignificant to store the number of cars
Opinion;and so do cars equaltraffic
Opinion;Are we saying thoseare equal?
Opinion;areroads a significant thing here
Opinion;but do we really want to stopthe number of cars it keeps queuing up
Opinion;But then do you have to specifyoutput points?
Opinion;Can we capture that
Opinion;Do the roads delegate this, or do the intersections delegate all thecommunication
Opinion;do we care about you anymore?

Opinion;how do you definethe behavior of the traffic
Opinion;how do you do the traffic?
Opinion;how does thatwork? 
Opinion;how does thisimpact what we need to model? 
Opinion;I mean areroads saying, can I go? Can I go? Or are the intersectionsÇ-shouldthe intersection tell the road, you know, flow you know five cars.
Opinion;is itÇ-does it really stop? 
Opinion;Or do we care?
Opinion;orÇ-how does this look
Opinion;So how do you share that informationacross all the signals.
Opinion;So what are the aspects of the speed that are important?
Opinion;So what are the properties of traffic
Opinion;Sodo we want to model that kind of multiÇ-thread of randombehavior? I think so
Opinion;thatÇ-is that more of the signals?
Opinion;The problem is how do youtell the intersection what road this connects to
Opinion;then it's an output?
Opinion;what are the properties of this? 
Opinion;What does the sensor do
Opinion;what simplifying assumptions could we make initially and findthose
Opinion;whathappens in this model?
Opinion;which ones do we want to have 
Propose Exception; but also at eachintersection you can say this percentage is going to do this forvarying reasons that we don't
Propose Exception; I see the big picture, but I don't know the intersections
Propose Exception;But at 
Propose Exception;but do we really want to stopthe number of cars it keeps queuing up
Propose Exception;but I'm
Propose Exception;but lengthis 
Propose Exception;But then do you have to specifyoutput points?
Propose Exception;But then this 
Propose Exception;but we may need to trackÇ-we may need toset up outputs you know
Propose Exception;but what would the outputs necessarily be of that
Propose Exception;But, I think
Propose Exception;Butthen there's 
Propose Exception;butthis can be dictated 
Propose Exception;It's just a green but
Reinforce; yeah that makes sense
Reinforce;, that makes a lot of sense
Reinforce;A queue with a limit
Reinforce;because you're right
Reinforce;Exactly
Reinforce;Exactly
Reinforce;Exactly, exactly.
Reinforce;Exactly, yeah exactly.
Reinforce;Interesting question

Reinforce;that makes sense
Reinforce;That's interesting
Reinforce;That's the perfect simplification.
Reinforce;That's what I'm trying to figure out.
Reinforce;Yeah, exactly.
Reject;No
Rephrase;Imean they can't make a left

Request; does it run on a clock or does it run, you knowhow do you control this flow behavior?

Request;So what are the aspects of the speed that are important?
Request;So what are the properties of traffic
Request;Sodo we want to model that kind of multiÇ-thread of randombehavior? I think so
Request;thatÇ-is that more of the signals?
Request;That's where I always liketo start. How do you see the code beingÇ-just kind of thestructure of it being broken down? 
Request;The only thing I'm kind of botheredis how do weÇ-how does this guy come into play in all of this?
Request;The problem is how do youtell the intersection what road this connects to
Request;The sensors?
Request;then it's an output?
Request;What about it?
Request;what are the properties of this?

Request Attention;Really
Request Confirmation;do we really want that
Request Confirmation;is it safe from stuff like that
Request Confirmation;Is that really the only thing?
Request Confirmation;kind of? 
Request Confirmation;right
Request Confirmation;so can you hit all the green
Request Confirmation;This is on the road isn't it
Request Confirmation;well?
Request Focus Change;And since it's a multiÇ-intersection problem 
Request Focus Change;figure out if roads connect tointersections, traffic contains, lets think about containment a littlebit here
Request Focus Change;Lets look for error
Request Focus Change;let'sfocus on kind of 
Request Focus Change;Next question
Request Focus Change;Rules for the signals.
Request Focus Change;so nowcome back up, what big concepts haven't we captured yet
Request Focus Change;We need to think about the big picture
Scoping;So this is really all the editing someone's going to need to playwith, good, kind of? Concerned with too much detail 
Structural Decision; in terms of software structure, it looks like a classic O.O.problem 
Structural Decision; Itseems like there's a modeling engine, you know. Its going to runanywhere essentially and it's going to use its internal data model,object model
Structural Decision; think theintersections, the roads, and so let's think about how these tworelate
Structural Decision;, I mean it just consists of a set of intersectionsconnected by roads so.
Structural Decision;an encapsulated entity 
Structural Decision;from there how do you getthese guys correlated into the system
Structural Decision;Okay so the intersection has, Has Car, it's running it's own thread,
Structural Decision;So each one's got a state: either red, yellow, green. And thatdictates what's happening between these guys
Structural Decision;So there's this, this relationship here. Each road connects to twointersections
Structural Decision;So we definitely have, I mean we have the general concept of amap, which is going to be the big container for everything.
Structural Decision;That's going to have a lane so section needs to be divisible, weneed some type of object representing that road
Structural Decision;the road is an object, and it's operations it hasare like: add car
Structural Decision;The roads are queue's per lane.
Structural Decision;The roads connect the intersections.
Structural Decision;They have signals
Structural Decision;this mainmap controller is the crank that starts the whole system and whatits going to do. 
Structural Decision;this metaÇ-controller
Structural Decision;time component attachedto each one of these things. And then the sensor comes into playtoo.
Structural Decision;Traffic
Structural Decision;We can think about how to structure this. We can say IÇ-1, IÇ-2, RÇ-1,2.
Suggest; I think, kind of the we would have to use[inaudible
Suggest; I thinkwe just go off the number of signals at each intersection. 
Suggest; think one thing is that the controls have to modify the signaltimings and the sensors so we basically got to just basically sayhere's
Suggest; think that at that point,we don't really care.
Suggest; think there's another thing you captured here. There'sthese inputs. And the road can actually have or, you know.
Suggest; think we can make that first clean division
Suggest; think, is the model on which to build the end userapplication.
Suggest;I guess that dependency is really comes back to the signals
Suggest;I guess the issues that are going to come into play are 
Suggest;I think 
Suggest;I think it's a simplification
Suggest;I think it's just more consistent 
Suggest;I think it's more of a collection of signals because
Suggest;I think its more of the number of cars in period of time
Suggest;I think really we care more about 
Suggest;I think that these are the only ones that should be toggable
Suggest;I think the road's going to have to be a little bit smarter
Suggest;I think theintersection's going toÇ-basically its interface is looking at that,its going to say road give me left cars, give me straight cars, giveme right cars
Suggest;I think there's aÇ-should be [inaudible] this if not just two fulllanes
Suggest;I think they're pretty straightÇ-forwardobjects
Suggest;I think those were the main big players
Suggest;I think we have
Suggest;I'm saying this is probably the best assumption
Suggest;It seems like a, for this type of problem a good first attack is justkind of a, you know a data analysis
Suggest;so I think one of the things we'recoming out is the roadÇ-I don't know if it has lanes so much as ithas, you know left, straight, right.
Suggest;So let's go with the minimum so
Suggest;so maybe the data structure is set up where we don'tcare, I don't think we do care
Suggest;We can say IÇ-
Suggest;We might have to say add left caradd straight car, there might be more to the road I'm starting tothink.
Suggest;Yeah I'm justÇ-do a flat file, sterilize it all
Suggest;you know, the leftcan go at the same time and then.
Summarize Information;And so after we've set up this design, thisinput has some properties to define with it. Just going to be theflow in essentially as you described. And then you hit go,
Summarize Information;And so we think about, termination of, do we get flow out of thissystem, do we think about
Summarize Information;And so, you fire off youknow sticking our toe into dirty details, you fire off thread foreach input thing, and then each thread input is doing add a car ata particular flow
Summarize Information;But this defines in the data structure that we don't care.
Summarize Information;Covers most of our entities at least. What's going on. How theyinteract.
Summarize Information;It says we have to have a protected left
Summarize Information;Looks like basically two pieces: the interaction andthe code for map that's able to manipulate road systems with awhole bunch of details.
Summarize Information;Map going to have intersections. And then the intersections
Summarize Information;Number of cars andtravel time
Summarize Information;So it's interesting becausethe intersection has signals and the intersection has some controlof the signals. 
Summarize Information;so we have R1, and so R1 is
Summarize Information;So we start the simulation and it's going to start addingcars until it stops, then it's going to pull it see if there's moreroom.
Summarize Information;So we've decided that lanes, maybe not so significant
Summarize Information;So we've gotÇ-these are kind of the physicsthings, and kind of the abstract things we've got 
Summarize Information;too much about the lanes themselves.
Summarize Information;We've got traffic, intersections,
Summarize Information;We've got, you know kind of this set ofused cases about leftÇ-turn, straights
Summarize Information;You have two end points.
Suppose; if it doesn't have a sensor it just assumes, justignores the poll
Suppose; if we continue the hierarchy of the signals, the rules
Suppose; if you envisioned some sort of[inaudible] package then there'd be sort of this thing you knowthey'd drop a leftÇ-turn signal in there, and a straight signal
Suppose; if you have a light dictating left, it's always goingto be a left turn and straight and more often
Suppose;if it blocks, the queue tells it hey I'mfull, that thread has to stop you know and then it's got to pull it tomake it go again
Suppose;if some carhere is wanting to go straight and this is backed up, they cannot
Suppose;if the queue is empty on the road, don't trigger it green
Suppose;if theres a one way road, so basically there's only one endpoint on this road
Suppose;If theres no traffic
Suppose;if there's no traffic, neverturn it green.
Suppose;if this road fills up, it's going to have to know I'm full, I can'taccept anymore traffic coming down my way.
Suppose;if we just say has the car,and then the rules come in here whether it's sensored or nonsensored.
Suppose;If we make the assumption that we're not going to have so a twolaneroad that turns into a oneÇ-lane road, I think we're fineÇ-
Suppose;if we think about, you know,somebody is going to say start feeding cars in here, and then thisguy has to say hey I'm full, stop
Suppose;if you have one lane, you don't really run intoreality 
Suppose;if you're going to get back up here youcould potentially back it up into the next intersection dependingon this length here which is going to 
Suppose;If you'renot, if you don't want a sensor, they said they can have withoutsensors, then it's completely time based.
Suppose;If youthink of this as kind of an encapsulated entity then it's not goingto know about this.
Suppose;ifyou have a full lane everywhere in the intersection so everythingfits they're two lanes at that point.
Suppose;mean if you think of, you know desktop or 
Suppose;so if an intersection has a sensor, thenÇ-I think is that assimple as this intersection having API with the road calls? 
Suppose;this has a length, it never overflows, you know iften, five cars can fit then it's all
Suppose;you follow thepercentage model then we can just calculate what that wouldmean for the entry source of cars coming in.
Task; let's see what other data do we pull out
Task;And since it's a multiÇ-intersection problem 
Task;And so after we've set up this design, thisinput has some properties to define with it. Just going to be theflow in essentially as you described. And then you hit go,
Task;And so we think about, termination of, do we get flow out of thissystem, do we think about
Task;And so, you fire off youknow sticking our toe into dirty details, you fire off thread foreach input thing, and then each thread input is doing add a car ata particular flow
Task;But this defines in the data structure that we don't care.
Task;Call it a [inaudible] requirement. Cool. Let's check for anyother...
Task;Concerned with too much detail before weevenÇ-otherwise we're going to cut stuff out.
Task;Covers most of our entities at least. What's going on. How theyinteract.
Task;figure out if roads connect tointersections, traffic contains, lets think about containment a littlebit here
Task;I think we haveÇ-we can probably numerate the rules we'regoing to need too. 
Task;I want to start by hearing your summary of this
Task;It says we have to have a protected left
Task;let's dive into that a little bit.
Task;let's explore that
Task;Lets look for error
Task;let's put it in there and we'll capture that.
Task;Let's take that oneout
Task;let'sfocus on kind of 
Task;Looks like basically two pieces: the interaction andthe code for map that's able to manipulate road systems with awhole bunch of details.
Task;Map going to have intersections. And then the intersections
Task;Next question
Task;Number of cars andtravel time
Task;Rules for the signals.
Task;So it's interesting becausethe intersection has signals and the intersection has some controlof the signals. 
Task;So let's hide that detail. [inaudible]. 
Task;so nowcome back up, what big concepts haven't we captured yet
Task;so we have R1, and so R1 is
Task;So we start the simulation and it's going to start addingcars until it stops, then it's going to pull it see if there's moreroom.
Task;So we've decided that lanes, maybe not so significant
Task;So we've gotÇ-these are kind of the physicsthings, and kind of the abstract things we've got 
Task;start twoengineers on the model, one engineer on the UI. Get the modelgoing ahead. Cool.
Task;The next step I would do is to 
Task;too much about the lanes themselves.
Task;We need to think about the big picture
Task;We should model that
Task;We've got traffic, intersections,
Task;We've got, you know kind of this set ofused cases about leftÇ-turn, straights
Task;You have two end points.
Usability and User Interface;Drag and drop with a drill down for each to sayÇ-each individualthing you can mess with so a drill down for inputs, a drill downfor each signal.
Usability and User Interface;From this UI I mean
Usability and User Interface;I basically picture a drag and drop environment
Usability and User Interface;I think for the purpose of API we can, I think we can defineAPI from the perspective of each of the things and then divedown into the details
Usability and User Interface;is that the controls have to modify 
Usability and User Interface;Kind of a classic drawing package interface. Let's see.And of course this would need to be persistable
Usability and User Interface;they're going to define a flow into R1and then they're going to click go.
Use Case;Add car, you know thatreturns [inaudible], then you go is space? And we've got to pollso we've got theseÇ-
Use Case;be able toaccommodate at least six intersections, be able to control lights atan individual level
Use Case;Because really all they're saying is to be able to change trafficdensity
Use Case;knowthey'd drop a leftÇ-turn signal in there
Use Case;need to be able to control theinput 
Use Case;Somebody is controlling the interactions
Use Case;they can choose you know is it just a straight 
Use Case;they'd want to clickthe system and then sit there and watch it run and say
Use Case;they're designing intersections is kind of the keything

Agree;You are right, based on the current things it doesnít make too much sense that you have this reuse of traffic
Apologize;again sorry for my handwriting
Apologize;Ah sorry
Apologize;Iím sorry about my handwriting 
Apologize;Sorry for my handwriting
Apologize;Sorry I have
Apologize;Sorry.
Appreciation;is that okay?
Appreciation;Thanks a lot, thatís a compliment.
Appreciation;Thanks for the time, it was a nice design time so to say.
Appreciation;Yes, you too, thank you very much. It was fun.
Argue; But I mean having a selection is probably makes it
Argue; But is that? 
Argue; I agree on that
Argue; I donít see this specifically in the requirements
Argue; I mean it could be one or two I guess
Argue; I thought it would be different, but I guess this would also be fine
Argue; itís not stated there, but we think it would be useful
Argue; So I guess density is not enough
Argue;Ö I donít understand
Argue;Ah okay, you say this is some kind of, yeah, but this could be possible in both cases
Argue;And then we had the road endpoint which could either be a real endpoint or it could be an intersection
Argue;And this I guess is easier than doing the same logic and afterwards subdividing the roads always
Argue;And through the road endpoint it has one, two, four, Ö is possible, fourteen is not good
Argue;and we either have a real intersection or we have an end point
Argue;but also for calculating statistics
Argue;But first maybe we can discuss how to, whatís the best way to define the problem in itself
Argue;but how
Argue;but I assume roads will also be a form of association
Argue;but I donít know
Argue;but I would assume
Argue;but if you say map is our starting point and everything is connected to this by association or something like that would be fine for me. 
Argue;but itís just the surrounding 
Argue;But maybe first
Argue;but the overall implementation should be able to work with more roads or less.
Argue;but then again how would you declare
Argue;but we want to say if we make a throughput through the system via endpoints we would have traffic on endpoints
Argue;But why do I want to move the intersection?
Argue;But why donít we have a traffic model per se? 
Argue;But would traffic class in that case, does it make sense to have the relation to the road itself
Argue;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Argue;Do we want to make it easy and just have density as part of the road or do we want to make something more sophisticated in terms of traffic models.
Argue;donít know per what
Argue;For me it maybe doesnít make sense to have this as a specific intersection, maybe there we would have something different which is a kind of road entry or road exit
Argue;I asked if that is what you wanted, but it sounds like it was not
Argue;I donít know how much details we have
Argue;I donít know how to call it but we can also use it to influence the traffic from outside, which could be something specific
Argue;I donít know.
Argue;I mean another alternative would be to just have something like a default timing which you can change
Argue;I mean if we view a road that is the whole thing, the whole map, I mean it could have multiple intersections,
Argue;I would say both is good. I think default timing should also be available or which is always given and then you can define which default timing can be used.
Argue;Iím just thinking not only from a visualization perspective but also from a simulation perspective
Argue;Iím not so sure about that
Argue;Iím not sure
Argue;Iím not sure
Argue;Iím not sure what you mean by subset
Argue;If later on we have something not just four way but with this T-crossing, then we should easily be able to support this
Argue;if the map is changing in a way that you add another intersection in between the appearances of roads are recalculated, but this then is a letís say more complex part and you need to copy the attributes and so on so it shouldnít be so difficult
Argue;If the system is working, then additional things will be requested and itís better to have it already separated instead of putting all in one class
Argue;If the traffic model should be completely separate entity here, which relates to the map or if we should just make it easier just make the roads have a simple density.
Argue;if we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization in some sense 
Argue;If we want to make it more advanced in the future like you said with the more detailed definition of traffic for which kind of cars and so on we already have the right entry 
Argue;if we want to take the five we can make it even easier and say that roads have a single attribute saying density or something like that
Argue;If you follow the assignment I mean there is specifically mentioned traffic density for the roads, but then it wonít be as easy to calculate something like system throughput or anything like that so it could also be hard to simulate letís say the time it takes for a single car from point A to point B
Argue;if you move the intersection the road will become longer so I guess the velocity will have a different impact on the total throughput.
Argue;if you want to evaluate traffic, evaluate the performance of the traffic lights as a system itself
Argue;It could be open ended, it could be, I guess anything. A house or something
Argue;Itís not specifically defined but the purpose
Argue;Letís say you are in editor mode in the map and you want to move an intersection or something like that. Then moving that intersection would be very complicated, because you would have to take into account how the roads were drawn initially and so on.
Argue;Maybe I miss something right now but these are for my feelings the things we could represent in the class model.
Argue;mean if you only have one visual element then there is no point for it
Argue;Of course we can represent this here but we should also keep in mind that this could be changed in the future and that we should design the system that is able to change this.
Argue;So four
Argue;So if it comes to density I would add the traffic item not just having a description on the road, because I guess in which direction you are going, you want to have it more advanced and if we are starting the system these kinds of requirements will come
Argue;So if we donít have any traffic model per se we are only talking about how much density there is on a single road
Argue;So if we take this example and you just want to move this intersection over here instead. You have a road going out there, and another one going there, and another one going there. 
Argue;So itís clear that there could be not any more than four way intersections
Argue;So itís stated that it is related to the intersection, not to the road.
Argue;so then if I add a third road, then I would have this
Argue;So then you could follow an individual car how it goes through the map and then the simulation of every car that would be the traffic model with a density for a single road and so on.
Argue;So traffic light behavior can be defined
Argue;So we have to choose, one of them has to be open ended so to speak.
Argue;So you have the road endpoint, okay, and therefore we have, what was it? The road has two endpoints
Argue;T could be either a real endpoint or an intersection 
Argue;This makes the calculation more complicated, but on the other hand itís something like if we donít want to design or define traffic per road which is one of the tasks or requirements. 
Argue;traffic is not visualized really, and we could also have a visualization of the traffic, could make sense
Argue;we donít have I mean the visualization for it and Iím not sure how we should. 
Argue;we should have both
Argue;Yes, either a road or intersection. You can see the details.
Argue;You are right, based on the current things it doesnít make too much sense that you have this reuse of traffic
Assert;I donít see anything.
Assumption; I think about it I would also prefer to say road is something that is always between two intersections
Assumption; I think the sensors are on the road rather connecting the intersections rather than on the intersection 
Assumption; mean if thatís the case the traffic class would not translate very well to this global view of traffic
Assumption; per road or in general 
Assumption; We canít have an open ended intersections or open ended roads. 
Assumption;, I guess it doesnít really matter, but I mean if you move the intersection the road will become longer so I guess the velocity will have a different impact on the total throughput.
Assumption;a road has just two intersections
Assumption;And then we had the road endpoint which could either be a real endpoint or it could be an intersection
Assumption;Assuming every road is connected to two intersections
Assumption;Four traffic light at each intersection
Assumption;I donít know how to call it but we can also use it to influence the traffic from outside, which could be something specific
Assumption;I guess there should be some statistics in terms of like the total throughput of the system or something like that. Runtime statistics
Assumption;I mean endpoints wonít have traffic lights.
Assumption;I mean if we view a road that is the whole thing, the whole map, I mean it could have multiple intersections,
Assumption;I mean the naÔve way to go about it would just start with a map and then assume that everything is a subset of a map.
Assumption;I mean they should contain information like density and optionally it may have speed limits and so on.
Assumption;I think you could assign one timing behavior to different traffic lights, 
Assumption;I wanted to say that there is a traffic light at each intersection
Assumption;Iím just clarifying that there should be four traffic lights for each intersection, not a single one.
Assumption;In here we have road one and road two, which I this one. Or you can go to the other side and say okay, if I detect an intersection here, here is road one, here is road two, here is road three and four
Assumption;Is a road always that ending at an intersection or is a road like the designer when he starts to design the map, like I did right now?
Assumption;Maybe we should clarify that and say that there should be one traffic light at each entry point into the intersection
Assumption;Maybe we should clarify that each entry point into the intersection
Assumption;Maybe you want to calculate exactly how long it takes for a single car to go from one end to the other end of the map or something like that
Assumption;Okay itís always 4-way, it needs to be four traffic lights.
Assumption;Right now itís that roads are part of it, we have intersections, traffic will be there, traffic lights
Assumption;Should we also include the velocity, the speed limits of the cars
Assumption;So I guess the visual map is to replay the simulation and the road layout is to create new simulations
Assumption;So I would expect some overall either 2-D or 3-D visualization where you can directly create your traffics and then you could push some button on saying simulate and maybe during the simulation at runtime you can also change some parts, like changing the traffic density, velocity or the traffic light behavior.
Assumption;So if we donít have any traffic model per se we are only talking about how much density there is on a single road
Assumption;so visual map would be houses and the cars travelling on the road and so on
Assumption;the next one was: there are optional sensors for car detection.
Assumption;The speed limit should be the extra thing, itís not really necessary if we are only looking at road density.
Assumption;then the timing scheme. I guess there needs to be a timer for
Assumption;There is a traffic light at each intersection.
Assumption;These Intersections are always 4-way and in there.
Assumption;these roads can have intersections,
Assumption;This is something where just one line is defined and the road can have multiple intersections.
Assumption;visual map of the area, a road layout
Assumption;we also need to look at how fast the cars are while crossing each intersection.
Assumption;we have now described and also making the road layout is something you would also do on the visualization
Assumption;we need a visual map
Assumption;you can either say for the whole intersection there are sensors
Assumption;you should hopefully be able to see what the throughput is.
Awareness; Is this blue now or is this black now?
Awareness; which zoom level do we use? 
Awareness;, I was just trying to figure out where I wanted the 
Awareness;Are we too large now?
Awareness;Are you drawing the interface?
Awareness;Can you see what I am writing
Awareness;Did you draw it?
Awareness;Did you remove it? Okay
Awareness;Have you seen what Iím drawing on my side?
Awareness;I donít know.
Awareness;I zoom out a bit, I try to select 
Awareness;Is that big enough?
Awareness;Itís blue on this side.
Awareness;No it just popped up. I donít know where it came from, even in the wrong color.
Awareness;Not yet
Awareness;now I see
Awareness;Okay so I have a straight diagonal line
Awareness;On the right top, maybe you just zoom out a bit?
Awareness;So I delete it, because itís too close to the other part.
Awareness;What are you drawing now?
Awareness;what was that?
Awareness;where did you write?
Awareness;Yes I can read it
Awareness;You can read it?
Awareness;you see my line?
Awareness;You see what Iíve marked here
Clarification;Ah road density or traffic density?
Clarification;By moving the intersection you mean also changing the geometrical appearance of the roads?
Clarification;do you just want to be able to design the traffic for one of the parts?
Clarification;do you want to only be able to design the overall thing, which then would be an issue regarding the traffic
Clarification;Is a road always that ending at an intersection or is a road like the designer when he starts to design the map, like I did right now?
Clarification;Is it the traffic of the whole system or the traffic of a single road
Clarification;So whatís the difference between the visual map and the rad layout
Clarification;So you just mean the attributes regarding sensor and the assigned traffic lights and traffic behavior?
Clarification;What do you mean bigger level?
Clarification;What do you mean by moving the intersection?
Clarification;What do you want to say?
Clarification;what is the traffic class actually representing
Clarification;What were you thinking?
Clarification;Why what? The part I donít get is why we donít have traffic density.
Clarification;yes, I mean my main point is what would be part of that view?
Clarification;You mean attributes describing the geometrical positioning of everything?
Conciliate;Ah okay, you say this is some kind of, yeah, but this could be possible in both cases
Conciliate;I would say both is good. I think default timing should also be available or which is always given and then you can define which default timing can be used.
Conciliate;Iím just thinking not only from a visualization perspective but also from a simulation perspective
Conciliate;we should have both
Conciliate;Yes, either a road or intersection. You can see the details.
Coordinate Group Process; guess we are also finished regarding the time, I guess we can stop here.
Coordinate Group Process; I guess we can just restart
Coordinate Group Process; I mean best we have 20 minutes.
Coordinate Group Process; It could be some kind of traffic connected but we can also just leave it for now
Coordinate Group Process; Maybe we can remove it afterwards for other discussions?
Coordinate Group Process; say okay we do a different tree on the right side which is just the overall items and these could be specific items which are road. 
Coordinate Group Process; Should we go lower again and restart from the beginning, I donít think itís too difficult.
Coordinate Group Process;Ah okay, we have some time left. Thirty minutes, okay
Coordinate Group Process;but I just mark it blue to say we think it would be useful and should we go in this direction but to make a clear difference to what was our initial purpose regarding the requirements
Coordinate Group Process;But I would make a statement like, what is it, zoom out, view and the model ad in between there should be some kind of controller, I put it here.
Coordinate Group Process;but it really relates to exactly how ambitious we are
Coordinate Group Process;But this should be something we keep in mind saying thatÖ maybe I can write it here that this needs to be recalculated
Coordinate Group Process;Do we have other items we are currently missing?
Coordinate Group Process;How longÖ should we do this  to 10.30?
Coordinate Group Process;How much time is left? 10.30?
Coordinate Group Process;I can also do it in blue as it is not part of the requirements.
Coordinate Group Process;I think, I mean from the mental point of view I mean we are more or less done even if we define the controller and some use cases itís more boiler plate type of things.
Coordinate Group Process;I will draw traffic, traffic light and traffic light behavior in parallel
Coordinate Group Process;I would say itís too much, we donít get this done in time.
Coordinate Group Process;later on we could also have this for the purposes you have described that all the attributes of the car like length or speed could influence the traffic at all.
Coordinate Group Process;maybe for now itís fine in that way.
Coordinate Group Process;Maybe thatís also something that we cannot design right now in time
Coordinate Group Process;Maybe we check again the requirements, just go maybe through what we have or if we have everything. 
Coordinate Group Process;Not that I can think of, maybe we can read the requirements again.
Coordinate Group Process;Now we can move it.
Coordinate Group Process;Okay then maybe letís check again the requirements
Coordinate Group Process;so itís currently maybe a question how much is really necessary
Coordinate Group Process;so maybe we draw this and then we make a component diagram sketch on saying which items we would put together and thatís it 
Coordinate Group Process;so maybe you start to do something and then I will continue that
Coordinate Group Process;suspect we are going to have a lot of use cases, not sure we have the time for that.
Coordinate Group Process;Then I will remove it again
Coordinate Group Process;This is also why I would do this in blue meaning this could also be an additional information
Coordinate Group Process;This is where Iím thinking about kind of which view we should have on this, 
Coordinate Group Process;What is the next? 
Coordinate Group Process;What was the timing? How much time is left for the design phase? (asking Andreas) Who?
Coordinate Group Process;Yes I would say letís start easy and we can add additional things later on
Design Principle;model-view-controller pattern 
Design Principle;Then we have the model, we have the view, but we donít have the controller
Design Principle;we have a statement that we do model view controller pattern
Disagree; I donít see this specifically in the requirements
Disagree;For me it maybe doesnít make sense to have this as a specific intersection, maybe there we would have something different which is a kind of road entry or road exit
Doubt;Ö I donít understand
Doubt;but I donít know
Doubt;donít know per what
Doubt;I donít know how much details we have
Doubt;I donít know.
Doubt;Iím not so sure about that
Doubt;Iím not sure
Doubt;Iím not sure
Doubt;Iím not sure what you mean by subset
Doubt;we donít have I mean the visualization for it and Iím not sure how we should. 
Driver; a bit more usable so I agree
Driver; advanced in the future 
Driver; And then the point could be I guess for future could define anything
Driver;it would also be always given indirectly. It takes less work for the editing, you can easily just draw the lines and each time you would have here endpoints an intersections which are all calculated automatically and then by selecting an intersection you could describe the movement of an intersection, which is a more advanced algorithm to relayout the whole thing.
Driver;Of course we can represent this here but we should also keep in mind that this could be changed in the future and that we should design the system that is able to change this.
Driver;so I see a reuse potential there
Driver;Yes I would keep the traffic class also for reuse purposes
Elaborate;what did I say? ìRoad endpointsî, four and one. Then we would have ìroadî
Elaboration; do you have a better statement? 
Elaboration;I mean what are the types of metrics that we want to have in percent?
Encourage;I think itís a good and great idea
Encourage;Thatís a good point
Encourage;Yes I agree. Great
Encourage;Yes thatís a good idea.
Encourage;Yes, I think itís a good idea
Explain and Clarify;. You would have some kind of patterns for traffic lights, different ones which you will use on different intersections
Explain and Clarify;at least a starting point and end point
Explain and Clarify;for me itís the traffic on a single road
Explain and Clarify;From my understanding it was like for the for the designer yes, the designer of the traffic just wants to define traffic either on the road or as input output for the system on endpoints, 
Explain and Clarify;I guess it relates to if we should do this system level simulation or not, otherwise it doesnít make sense to have it.
Explain and Clarify;I mean if we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization in some sense so that the visualization part would be, would have the play buttons and the simulations and all of that.
Explain and Clarify;I mean if you have an open ended road you should somehow be able to define that only one end should have an intersection and the other one should have not
Explain and Clarify;Iím just clarifying that there should be four traffic lights for each intersection, not a single one.
Explain and Clarify;mean we send it to be part of the intersection
Explain and Clarify;Now I have another road and here is my first intersection. And now Iím adding another road and here I have another intersection
Explain and Clarify;the first thing is only that everything is layouted. It could be also both but this is more detailed meaning that in this visual map. So the map at all I donít know how much details we have, but itís just the surrounding and base don that you can add roads.
Implementation Decision;And not the primitive type that was essentially
Implementation Decision;but the overall implementation should be able to work with more roads or less.
Implementation Decision;for now we donít have any attributes for the endpoint
Implementation Decision;in there, there is a Boolean attribute indicating the sensors are available.
Implementation Decision;is it an attribute for the road?
Implementation Decision;so letís add an interface then
Implementation Decision;So we do some kind of extra class or interface for intersection 
Implementation Decision;the name for the interface
Infer; So I guess density is not enough
Infer;And this I guess is easier than doing the same logic and afterwards subdividing the roads always
Infer;Letís say you are in editor mode in the map and you want to move an intersection or something like that. Then moving that intersection would be very complicated, because you would have to take into account how the roads were drawn initially and so on.
Infer;So four
Infer;So if it comes to density I would add the traffic item not just having a description on the road, because I guess in which direction you are going, you want to have it more advanced and if we are starting the system these kinds of requirements will come
Infer;So if we take this example and you just want to move this intersection over here instead. You have a road going out there, and another one going there, and another one going there. 
Infer;So itís clear that there could be not any more than four way intersections
Infer;So itís stated that it is related to the intersection, not to the road.
Infer;So then you could follow an individual car how it goes through the map and then the simulation of every car that would be the traffic model with a density for a single road and so on.
Infer;So traffic light behavior can be defined
Infer;So you have the road endpoint, okay, and therefore we have, what was it? The road has two endpoints
Inform; I guess should be to have a look at congestion and see how many cars can actually get through during a certain amount of time
Inform; I guess there needs to be a timer for
Inform; I have traffic density can be changed.
Inform; I think itís useful, 
Inform; I think the sensors are on the road rather connecting the intersections rather than on the intersection 
Inform; it could be that this is roads specific
Inform;. You would have some kind of patterns for traffic lights, different ones which you will use on different intersections
Inform;Ah okay, road. We would have roads
Inform;Although for roads it would be a bit more tricky because I mean if we zoom in the sign that every road has two intersections, it doesnít fit, because at the edges of the map we have to have something else.
Inform;at least a starting point and end point
Inform;for me itís the traffic on a single road
Inform;From my understanding it was like for the for the designer yes, the designer of the traffic just wants to define traffic either on the road or as input output for the system on endpoints, 
Inform;I donít see anything.
Inform;I donít think that you want to redefine it for each intersection again and again if the timing is the same
Inform;I guess it relates to if we should do this system level simulation or not, otherwise it doesnít make sense to have it.
Inform;I guess the map can stay there
Inform;I guess there should be some statistics in terms of like the total throughput of the system or something like that. Runtime statistics
Inform;I guess this four is representing what is required right now
Inform;I guess timing behavior would be something in relation to traffic lights
Inform;I guess we could do it as a hit map for the road in visualization mode
Inform;I mean if we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization in some sense so that the visualization part would be, would have the play buttons and the simulations and all of that.
Inform;I mean if you have an open ended road you should somehow be able to define that only one end should have an intersection and the other one should have not
Inform;I mean the combination of possible roads would become a combinatorial exploration
Inform;I mean the naÔve way to go about it would just start with a map and then assume that everything is a subset of a map.
Inform;I mean they should contain information like density and optionally it may have speed limits and so on.
Inform;I think we should then move to stages sooner or later
Inform;I would like to use the abstraction level we have here at the requirement level
Inform;I would say we have a visual item and that could be either road or traffic light or car
Inform;Iím just clarifying that there should be four traffic lights for each intersection, not a single one.
Inform;Iím just thinking about the different other possible use cases.
Inform;It is: Behavior can be defined at each intersection
Inform;it would be road property I think
Inform;Maybe we can also move it. Maybe itís possible, I can try
Inform;maybe we donít even need a tool box
Inform;maybe we just keep this in mind and then itís fine
Inform;Maybe we should clarify that and say that there should be one traffic light at each entry point into the intersection
Inform;Maybe we should clarify that each entry point into the intersection
Inform;Maybe you want to calculate exactly how long it takes for a single car to go from one end to the other end of the map or something like that
Inform;mean we send it to be part of the intersection
Inform;Now I have another road and here is my first intersection. And now Iím adding another road and here I have another intersection
Inform;Should we also include the velocity, the speed limits of the cars
Inform;So I guess the visual map is to replay the simulation and the road layout is to create new simulations
Inform;So I would expect some overall either 2-D or 3-D visualization where you can directly create your traffics and then you could push some button on saying simulate and maybe during the simulation at runtime you can also change some parts, like changing the traffic density, velocity or the traffic light behavior.
Inform;So what I would like to have is some kind of traffic library
Inform;Speed limit I would say rather
Inform;Thatís just to kind of make it visually appealing in the map mode. 
Inform;The first one was for me that we need a visual map
Inform;the first thing is only that everything is layouted. It could be also both but this is more detailed meaning that in this visual map. So the map at all I donít know how much details we have, but itís just the surrounding and base don that you can add roads.
Inform;The timing behavior would be something related to traffic lights.
Inform;then the next one was: there are optional sensors for car detection.
Inform;There seems to be two moves
Inform;This is a road. I added a road to the system
Inform;to the roads, not the intersections
Inform;we also need to look at how fast the cars are while crossing each intersection.
Inform;We canít have an open ended intersections or open ended roads. 
Inform;We could do such a thing
Inform;we could either now think about some technical aspects meaning for the visualization on the letís say more component diagram level which items do we need or maybe first of all we maybe make a class diagram for the different items, which should be represented by the software referencing to the requirements
Inform;We could have some kind of input traffic, but the traffic is already designed per road
Inform;we just use this part as a new road and this part as a new road
Inform;We start with the plane map without any roads and then we can add some. 
Inform;what did I say? ìRoad endpointsî, four and one. Then we would have ìroadî
Inform;Yes maybe road traffic
Inform;Yes, how much in detail thatís something we can discuss
Inform;You have the speed limit of the roads, but then also the velocity of the cars
Inform;you should hopefully be able to see what the throughput is.
Information; do we have something in vision
Information;Are you writing anything right now?
Information;do you have other points regarding what you can design on the map? 
Information;Do you have something else?
Information;how do we continue based on that?
Information;how do you know where one road starts and where one ends?
Information;Is this something which is defined in the task or do you think itís just optional we could add it?
Information;Okay, so visual map would be houses and the cars travelling on the road and so on?
Information;so what was the question? 
Information;the only thing that is actually set is the density per road what would that view contain?
Information;The question is what do you want to do as a designer?
Information;the question is what is a road? 
Information;What is it?
Information;What more do we have as part of the intersection? 
Information;what was it
Information;What was it? 
Information;what was your point? 
Information;where did you write?
Information;Yes, so anything else?
Information;You asked if we have another attribute for intersection?
Information;You mean each traffic light?
Justification;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Justification;Is it currently disturbing
Justification;Is it mentioned in the task or do you just think it would be useful?
Justify;I guess this four is representing what is required right now
Justify;Iím just thinking about the different other possible use cases.
Justify;maybe we donít even need a tool box
Justify;Thatís just to kind of make it visually appealing in the map mode. 
Justify;we just use this part as a new road and this part as a new road
Lead; I guess should be to have a look at congestion and see how many cars can actually get through during a certain amount of time
Lead; I have traffic density can be changed.
Lead;Ah okay, road. We would have roads
Lead;Although for roads it would be a bit more tricky because I mean if we zoom in the sign that every road has two intersections, it doesnít fit, because at the edges of the map we have to have something else.
Lead;I donít think that you want to redefine it for each intersection again and again if the timing is the same
Lead;I guess we could do it as a hit map for the road in visualization mode
Lead;I think we should then move to stages sooner or later
Lead;I would like to use the abstraction level we have here at the requirement level
Lead;It is: Behavior can be defined at each intersection
Lead;So I guess the visual map is to replay the simulation and the road layout is to create new simulations
Lead;So I would expect some overall either 2-D or 3-D visualization where you can directly create your traffics and then you could push some button on saying simulate and maybe during the simulation at runtime you can also change some parts, like changing the traffic density, velocity or the traffic light behavior.
Lead;So what I would like to have is some kind of traffic library
Lead;Speed limit I would say rather
Lead;The first one was for me that we need a visual map
Lead;then the next one was: there are optional sensors for car detection.
Lead;There seems to be two moves
Lead;This is a road. I added a road to the system
Lead;we also need to look at how fast the cars are while crossing each intersection.
Lead;We canít have an open ended intersections or open ended roads. 
Lead;we could either now think about some technical aspects meaning for the visualization on the letís say more component diagram level which items do we need or maybe first of all we maybe make a class diagram for the different items, which should be represented by the software referencing to the requirements
Lead;We start with the plane map without any roads and then we can add some. 
Lead;You have the speed limit of the roads, but then also the velocity of the cars
Lead;you should hopefully be able to see what the throughput is.
Maintenance; Does that fit to you view as well?
Maintenance;A sketch for the interface?
Maintenance;again sorry for my handwriting
Maintenance;Ah sorry
Maintenance;But we have the roads.
Maintenance;Did you remove it?
Maintenance;Do you understand my point?
Maintenance;do you want to do it or should I continue?
Maintenance;Do you want to model as use case?
Maintenance;Have you seen what Iím drawing on my side?
Maintenance;How much time is left? 10.30?
Maintenance;Huh? Road Traffic? 
Maintenance;I start with a map?
Maintenance;Iím sorry about my handwriting 
Maintenance;Is it okay in that state?
Maintenance;is it okay?
Maintenance;Is my handwriting okay? 
Maintenance;Is that big enough?
Maintenance;is that okay?
Maintenance;Is that okay?
Maintenance;Maybe just call it tool box or something like that
Maintenance;Really? 
Maintenance;Remove everything
Maintenance;right
Maintenance;right
Maintenance;right? 
Maintenance;right?
Maintenance;right? 
Maintenance;right?
Maintenance;right?
Maintenance;right?
Maintenance;right?
Maintenance;right? 
Maintenance;right? 
Maintenance;right?
Maintenance;right? 
Maintenance;right? Is that correct?
Maintenance;Should I start?
Maintenance;Should we do a drawing for that or
Maintenance;Should we draw it in detail or do we just make a statement on what we have, what needs to be visualized, the roads, the traffic lights and the cars
Maintenance;Sorry
Maintenance;Sorry for my handwriting
Maintenance;Sorry I have
Maintenance;Sorry.
Maintenance;Sorry?
Maintenance;That will be the timing scheme?
Maintenance;Then I remove the drawings of the roads?
Maintenance;we could do just a mock up if you like
Maintenance;What am I doing wrong? 
Maintenance;which is if we go to the visual item and have the map is okay, isnít it?
Maintenance;Why we move the intersection you mean?
Maintenance;Would that be okay?
Maintenance;You can read it?
Maintenance;You mean each traffic light?
Maintenance;you see my line?
Maintenance;You want me to try? Okay
Motivate; should make it much easier, youíre right
Motivate;Alright, yes, sure
Motivate;Fair enough.
Motivate;I think itís a good and great idea
Motivate;I think itís a good idea
Motivate;Same thing here
Motivate;So I usually start with a data model, so a class diagram is probably a good idea
Motivate;Sure.
Motivate;Thatís a good point
Motivate;Thatís fine
Motivate;We need to do one of the representations meaning thatÖ I mean you are right on the loose ends, I agree on that
Motivate;Yes I agree. Great
Motivate;Yes thatís a good idea.
Motivate;Yes thatís fine.
Motivate;Yes, for sure
Motivate;Yes, I think itís a good idea
Motivate;you are right
Notation Decision;Ö we should have some description on how is the interaction with the system which you could also do via use case,
Notation Decision;do we also go on some behavioral aspects
Notation Decision;letís say more component diagram level 
Notation Decision;maybe first of all we maybe make a class diagram 
Notation Decision;maybe we draw this and then we make a component diagram sketch 
Notation Decision;So I usually start with a data model, so a class diagram is probably a good idea
Notation Decision;some use cases or something like that
Offer Alternative; I mean it could be one or two I guess
Offer Alternative;And then we had the road endpoint which could either be a real endpoint or it could be an intersection
Offer Alternative;And through the road endpoint it has one, two, four, Ö is possible, fourteen is not good
Offer Alternative;and we either have a real intersection or we have an end point
Offer Alternative;Do we want to make it easy and just have density as part of the road or do we want to make something more sophisticated in terms of traffic models.
Offer Alternative;I mean another alternative would be to just have something like a default timing which you can change
Offer Alternative;If the traffic model should be completely separate entity here, which relates to the map or if we should just make it easier just make the roads have a simple density.
Offer Alternative;It could be open ended, it could be, I guess anything. A house or something
Offer Alternative;So we have to choose, one of them has to be open ended so to speak.
Offer Alternative;T could be either a real endpoint or an intersection 
Offer Alternative;This makes the calculation more complicated, but on the other hand itís something like if we donít want to design or define traffic per road which is one of the tasks or requirements. 
Opinion; is there a speed limit of the road or the actual velocity of the car going through the road because that might not be the same
Opinion; Is there something in addition we want to have
Opinion;And how are those most easily calculated?
Opinion;did I misinterpret that
Opinion;How do we want the relations to be?
Opinion;In the middle?
Opinion;itís okay if I add density to the traffic?
Opinion;One traffic light should have a single intersection, right?
Opinion;Or is there something specific which we would like to have on endpoints
Opinion;Road endpoint, maybe?
Opinion;Shoud I call it single traffic, road traffic , specific traffic,
Opinion;Should it be on a bigger level?
Opinion;Should it be on a kind of big level or is it sufficient to just have a number of intersections with roads connecting them in terms of class relationships I mean.
Opinion;Should we do a drawing for that 
Opinion;Would that not be a property of the intersection?
Propose Exception; But I mean having a selection is probably makes it
Propose Exception; But is that? 
Propose Exception; I thought it would be different, but I guess this would also be fine
Propose Exception; itís not stated there, but we think it would be useful
Propose Exception;but also for calculating statistics
Propose Exception;But first maybe we can discuss how to, whatís the best way to define the problem in itself
Propose Exception;but how
Propose Exception;but I assume roads will also be a form of association
Propose Exception;but I would assume
Propose Exception;but if you say map is our starting point and everything is connected to this by association or something like that would be fine for me. 
Propose Exception;but itís just the surrounding 
Propose Exception;But maybe first
Propose Exception;but the overall implementation should be able to work with more roads or less.
Propose Exception;but then again how would you declare
Propose Exception;but we want to say if we make a throughput through the system via endpoints we would have traffic on endpoints
Propose Exception;But why do I want to move the intersection?
Propose Exception;But why donít we have a traffic model per se? 
Propose Exception;But would traffic class in that case, does it make sense to have the relation to the road itself
Propose Exception;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Propose Exception;I asked if that is what you wanted, but it sounds like it was not
Propose Exception;I donít know how to call it but we can also use it to influence the traffic from outside, which could be something specific
Propose Exception;Itís not specifically defined but the purpose
Propose Exception;Maybe I miss something right now but these are for my feelings the things we could represent in the class model.
Propose Exception;Of course we can represent this here but we should also keep in mind that this could be changed in the future and that we should design the system that is able to change this.
Reinforce; should make it much easier, youíre right
Reinforce;Alright, yes, sure
Reinforce;Fair enough.
Reinforce;I think itís a good idea
Reinforce;Same thing here
Reinforce;So I usually start with a data model, so a class diagram is probably a good idea
Reinforce;Sure.
Reinforce;Thatís fine
Reinforce;We need to do one of the representations meaning thatÖ I mean you are right on the loose ends, I agree on that
Reinforce;Yes thatís fine.
Reinforce;Yes, for sure
Reinforce;you are right
Reject;Ah no
Reject;No
Reject;No
Reject;no
Request; do we have something in vision
Request; do you have a better statement? 
Request; is there a speed limit of the road or the actual velocity of the car going through the road because that might not be the same
Request; Is there something in addition we want to have
Request;Ah road density or traffic density?
Request;And how are those most easily calculated?
Request;Are you writing anything right now?
Request;By moving the intersection you mean also changing the geometrical appearance of the roads?
Request;did I misinterpret that
Request;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Request;do you have other points regarding what you can design on the map? 
Request;Do you have something else?
Request;do you just want to be able to design the traffic for one of the parts?
Request;do you want to only be able to design the overall thing, which then would be an issue regarding the traffic
Request;how do we continue based on that?
Request;How do we want the relations to be?
Request;how do you know where one road starts and where one ends?
Request;I mean what are the types of metrics that we want to have in percent?
Request;In the middle?
Request;Is a road always that ending at an intersection or is a road like the designer when he starts to design the map, like I did right now?
Request;Is it currently disturbing
Request;Is it mentioned in the task or do you just think it would be useful?
Request;Is it the traffic of the whole system or the traffic of a single road
Request;Is this something which is defined in the task or do you think itís just optional we could add it?
Request;itís okay if I add density to the traffic?
Request;Okay, so visual map would be houses and the cars travelling on the road and so on?
Request;One traffic light should have a single intersection, right?
Request;Or is there something specific which we would like to have on endpoints
Request;Road endpoint, maybe?
Request;Shoud I call it single traffic, road traffic , specific traffic,
Request;Should it be on a bigger level?
Request;Should it be on a kind of big level or is it sufficient to just have a number of intersections with roads connecting them in terms of class relationships I mean.
Request;Should we do a drawing for that 
Request;so what was the question? 
Request;So whatís the difference between the visual map and the rad layout
Request;So you just mean the attributes regarding sensor and the assigned traffic lights and traffic behavior?
Request;the only thing that is actually set is the density per road what would that view contain?
Request;The question is what do you want to do as a designer?
Request;the question is what is a road? 
Request;What do you mean bigger level?
Request;What do you mean by moving the intersection?
Request;What do you want to say?
Request;What is it?
Request;what is the traffic class actually representing
Request;What more do we have as part of the intersection? 
Request;what was it
Request;What was it? 
Request;what was your point? 
Request;What were you thinking?
Request;where did you write?
Request;Why what? The part I donít get is why we donít have traffic density.
Request;Would that not be a property of the intersection?
Request;yes, I mean my main point is what would be part of that view?
Request;Yes, so anything else?
Request;You asked if we have another attribute for intersection?
Request;You mean attributes describing the geometrical positioning of everything?
Request;You mean each traffic light?
Request Attention;But we have the roads.
Request Attention;Huh? Road Traffic? 
Request Attention;Really? 
Request Attention;Sorry
Request Attention;Sorry?
Request Attention;What am I doing wrong? 
Request Confirmation; Does that fit to you view as well?
Request Confirmation;A sketch for the interface?

Request Confirmation;Why we move the intersection you mean?
Request Confirmation;Would that be okay?
Request Confirmation;You can read it?
Request Confirmation;You mean each traffic light?
Request Confirmation;you see my line?
Request Focus Change;I mean letís take your example here. Let me draw
Request Focus Change;I would take something like blue to highlight something which is currently not directly in the requirements
Scoping;Iím currently not hundred percent sure what also the customer wants and what the budget is and therefore 
Structural Decision; You would have two instances, a starting endpoint, then an ending endpoint, something like that for the interface.
Structural Decision;. So this means we would continue with having roads and a road has always one to two intersections.
Structural Decision;Ah okay, road. We would have roads
Structural Decision;Although for roads it would be a bit more tricky because I mean if we zoom in the sign that every road has two intersections, it doesnít fit, because at the edges of the map we have to have something else.
Structural Decision;And then just have cars associated with the map and road
Structural Decision;And through the road endpoint it has one, two, four, Ö is possible, fourteen is not good
Structural Decision;but I assume roads will also be a form of association
Structural Decision;but we want to say if we make a throughput through the system via endpoints we would have traffic on endpoints
Structural Decision;But would traffic class in that case, does it make sense to have the relation to the road itself
Structural Decision;Do we want to make it easy and just have density as part of the road or do we want to make something more sophisticated in terms of traffic models.
Structural Decision;For me it maybe doesnít make sense to have this as a specific intersection, maybe there we would have something different which is a kind of road entry or road exit
Structural Decision;From my understanding it was like for the for the designer yes, the designer of the traffic just wants to define traffic either on the road or as input output for the system on endpoints, 
Structural Decision;I guess timing behavior would be something in relation to traffic lights
Structural Decision;I mean in the basic, basic view 
Structural Decision;I was talking about this abstract or interface which is just a road endpoint
Structural Decision;If the traffic model should be completely separate entity here, which relates to the map or if we should just make it easier just make the roads have a simple density.
Structural Decision;Is it the traffic of the whole system or the traffic of a single road
Structural Decision;is there a speed limit of the road or the actual velocity of the car going through the road because that might not be the same.
Structural Decision;It should also have traffic lights as an association I guess
Structural Decision;it should be four, or actually it should be two.
Structural Decision;Itís better that we make an overall abstract statement in the time
Structural Decision;later on we could also have this for the purposes you have described that all the attributes of the car like length or speed could influence the traffic at all.
Structural Decision;Maybe I would actually draw traffic as a completely separate entity
Structural Decision;okay, so I put the velocity here.
Structural Decision;one of these is always connected to the road which would be enough. 
Structural Decision;One traffic light should have a single intersection, right?
Structural Decision;Road was for me another class.
Structural Decision;So here it is an intersection with traffic lights, which are from our understanding four, but letís say in general it could be a star
Structural Decision;so I would add a visual item
Structural Decision;So it could also be that intersection is just an subclass of endpoint 
Structural Decision;so this is just internals, maybe we need something more in terms of the visualization.
Structural Decision;the relation between traffic and road like a star, you could have this traffic item in the kind of library and just make it drag and drop to specific roads or endpoints that you can reuse the definition
Structural Decision;the system is working, then additional things will be requested and itís better to have it already separated instead of putting all in one class
Structural Decision;The timing behavior would be something related to traffic lights.
Structural Decision;then we have four of those
Structural Decision;Then we have the model, we have the view, but we donít have the controller
Structural Decision;Traffic here, traffic lights and then we add the timing behavior
Structural Decision;we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization 
Structural Decision;We donít need a traffic class.
Structural Decision;We have a map, some formal map, we have some formal representation of an intersection.
Structural Decision;what is the traffic class actually representing
Structural Decision;Yes I would keep the traffic class also for reuse purposes
Structural Decision;You could also do something like, letís say we have a traffic and this would have the cars with whatever attributes.
Suggest; I guess there needs to be a timer for
Suggest; I think itís useful, 
Suggest; I think the sensors are on the road rather connecting the intersections rather than on the intersection 
Suggest; it could be that this is roads specific
Suggest;I guess the map can stay there
Suggest;I guess there should be some statistics in terms of like the total throughput of the system or something like that. Runtime statistics
Suggest;I guess timing behavior would be something in relation to traffic lights
Suggest;I mean the combination of possible roads would become a combinatorial exploration
Suggest;I mean the naÔve way to go about it would just start with a map and then assume that everything is a subset of a map.
Suggest;I mean they should contain information like density and optionally it may have speed limits and so on.
Suggest;I would say we have a visual item and that could be either road or traffic light or car
Suggest;it would be road property I think
Suggest;Maybe we can also move it. Maybe itís possible, I can try
Suggest;maybe we just keep this in mind and then itís fine
Suggest;Maybe we should clarify that and say that there should be one traffic light at each entry point into the intersection
Suggest;Maybe we should clarify that each entry point into the intersection
Suggest;Maybe you want to calculate exactly how long it takes for a single car to go from one end to the other end of the map or something like that
Suggest;Should we also include the velocity, the speed limits of the cars
Suggest;The timing behavior would be something related to traffic lights.
Suggest;to the roads, not the intersections
Suggest;We could do such a thing
Suggest;We could have some kind of input traffic, but the traffic is already designed per road
Suggest;Yes maybe road traffic
Suggest;Yes, how much in detail thatís something we can discuss
Suggest Action;do you want to do it or should I continue?
Suggest Action;Do you want to model as use case?
Suggest Action;I start with a map?
Suggest Action;Maybe just call it tool box or something like that
Suggest Action;Should we do a drawing for that or
Suggest Action;Should we draw it in detail or do we just make a statement on what we have, what needs to be visualized, the roads, the traffic lights and the cars
Suggest Action;Then I remove the drawings of the roads?
Suggest Action;we could do just a mock up if you like
Suggest Action;You want me to try? Okay
Summarize Information; And you said it would be good to have traffic also visualized, 
Summarize Information;and velocity, yesÖ visualize at one time, light, trafficÖ
Summarize Information;For now we donít have any traffic, right? We have road density.
Summarize Information;If you look on the class diagrams we have these intersections and then we have traffic lights and then we have timing behavior.
Summarize Information;Letís check the other requirements. Ö sensors, okay, traffic can be defined at each intersection, yes. I have promised to read my own writing, traffic density per road, yes okay thatís fine. Velocity, okay, velocity should be one part of the road traffic
Summarize Information;letís say in general we already added in blue some additional attributes for the traffic. There could be more in the future, which could be of importance
Summarize Information;The road layout. So we have the visualization, we have the model, but we donít have talked too much about
Summarize Information;we have all data model, we have the view, we have the sketch
Summarize Information;We have talked about the road layout, we have road intersections in four-way but it could be also supporting more in the future, we have traffic lights at the intersections, optional we have the sensor attribute. Thatís something we have not drawn again, right? So the sensor attribute is road has sensors, right?
Suppose;I mean if we view a road that is the whole thing, the whole map, I mean it could have multiple intersections,
Suppose;If later on we have something not just four way but with this T-crossing, then we should easily be able to support this
Suppose;if the map is changing in a way that you add another intersection in between the appearances of roads are recalculated, but this then is a letís say more complex part and you need to copy the attributes and so on so it shouldnít be so difficult
Suppose;If the system is working, then additional things will be requested and itís better to have it already separated instead of putting all in one class
Suppose;if we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization in some sense 
Suppose;If we want to make it more advanced in the future like you said with the more detailed definition of traffic for which kind of cars and so on we already have the right entry 
Suppose;if we want to take the five we can make it even easier and say that roads have a single attribute saying density or something like that
Suppose;If you follow the assignment I mean there is specifically mentioned traffic density for the roads, but then it wonít be as easy to calculate something like system throughput or anything like that so it could also be hard to simulate letís say the time it takes for a single car from point A to point B
Suppose;if you move the intersection the road will become longer so I guess the velocity will have a different impact on the total throughput.
Suppose;if you want to evaluate traffic, evaluate the performance of the traffic lights as a system itself
Suppose;mean if you only have one visual element then there is no point for it
Suppose;So if we donít have any traffic model per se we are only talking about how much density there is on a single road
Suppose;so then if I add a third road, then I would have this
Task; And you said it would be good to have traffic also visualized, 
Task; guess we are also finished regarding the time, I guess we can stop here.
Task; I guess we can just restart
Task; I mean best we have 20 minutes.
Task; It could be some kind of traffic connected but we can also just leave it for now
Task; Maybe we can remove it afterwards for other discussions?
Task; say okay we do a different tree on the right side which is just the overall items and these could be specific items which are road. 
Task; Should we go lower again and restart from the beginning, I donít think itís too difficult.
Task;Ah okay, we have some time left. Thirty minutes, okay
Task;and velocity, yesÖ visualize at one time, light, trafficÖ
Task;but I just mark it blue to say we think it would be useful and should we go in this direction but to make a clear difference to what was our initial purpose regarding the requirements
Task;But I would make a statement like, what is it, zoom out, view and the model ad in between there should be some kind of controller, I put it here.
Task;but it really relates to exactly how ambitious we are
Task;But this should be something we keep in mind saying thatÖ maybe I can write it here that this needs to be recalculated
Task;Do we have other items we are currently missing?
Task;For now we donít have any traffic, right? We have road density.
Task;How longÖ should we do this  to 10.30?
Task;How much time is left? 10.30?
Task;I can also do it in blue as it is not part of the requirements.
Task;I mean letís take your example here. Let me draw
Task;I think, I mean from the mental point of view I mean we are more or less done even if we define the controller and some use cases itís more boiler plate type of things.
Task;I will draw traffic, traffic light and traffic light behavior in parallel
Task;I would say itís too much, we donít get this done in time.
Task;I would take something like blue to highlight something which is currently not directly in the requirements
Task;If you look on the class diagrams we have these intersections and then we have traffic lights and then we have timing behavior.
Task;later on we could also have this for the purposes you have described that all the attributes of the car like length or speed could influence the traffic at all.
Task;Letís check the other requirements. Ö sensors, okay, traffic can be defined at each intersection, yes. I have promised to read my own writing, traffic density per road, yes okay thatís fine. Velocity, okay, velocity should be one part of the road traffic
Task;letís say in general we already added in blue some additional attributes for the traffic. There could be more in the future, which could be of importance
Task;maybe for now itís fine in that way.
Task;Maybe thatís also something that we cannot design right now in time
Task;Maybe we check again the requirements, just go maybe through what we have or if we have everything. 
Task;Not that I can think of, maybe we can read the requirements again.
Task;Now we can move it.
Task;Okay then maybe letís check again the requirements
Task;so itís currently maybe a question how much is really necessary
Task;so maybe we draw this and then we make a component diagram sketch on saying which items we would put together and thatís it 
Task;so maybe you start to do something and then I will continue that
Task;suspect we are going to have a lot of use cases, not sure we have the time for that.
Task;The road layout. So we have the visualization, we have the model, but we donít have talked too much about
Task;Then I will remove it again
Task;This is also why I would do this in blue meaning this could also be an additional information
Task;This is where Iím thinking about kind of which view we should have on this, 
Task;we have all data model, we have the view, we have the sketch
Task;We have talked about the road layout, we have road intersections in four-way but it could be also supporting more in the future, we have traffic lights at the intersections, optional we have the sensor attribute. Thatís something we have not drawn again, right? So the sensor attribute is road has sensors, right?
Task;What is the next? 
Task;What was the timing? How much time is left for the design phase? (asking Andreas) Who?
Task;Yes I would say letís start easy and we can add additional things later on
Technical Problem;I cannot write anymore
Technical Problem;I just lost one line, I can add it
Technical Problem;Iím trying but it I not really working
Technical Question; I cantít do anything.
Technical Question;Can I move?
Technical Question;Can you repeat this? What do you want to do?
Technical Question;How can I move? (addressing technical assistant
Technical Question;How can I zoom? 
Technical Question;How longÖ should we do this  to 10.30? (Asking Rodi)
Technical Question;I donít know why. (talking in German to technical assistant) So now I have function again.
Technical Question;I tried to do something in a different color, it didnít work
Technical Question;Iím just thinking of how much time we have.
Technical Question;Iím trying to delete something, butÖ
Technical Question;it depends on you. I you finish before it is ok
Technical Question;it seems like the zoom is panning now instead
Technical Question;Itís starting to have trouble with the rendering, itís slower.
Technical Question;Move the class ting or something like that.
Technical Question;No you cannot move it I think.
Technical Question;Rodi? Is it possible to move a selected painting aroud?
Technical Question;So I can also not highlight something? This cannot be seen on the other part?
Technical Question;That would be a very great feature
Technical Question;think I zoomed out too much so itís starting to have trouble with the
Technical Question;Yes of course, but for now it doesnít work I think.
Usability and User Interface; I would like to have a traffic library where you can do via drag and dropÖ select single descriptions, so single items of traffic and drag and drop it to the intersections
Usability and User Interface; Iím just going to add the statistics window as an extra, down in the visualization
Usability and User Interface;A sketch for the interface?
Usability and User Interface;And I would, maybe another library which is not so optional would be the timing behavior
Usability and User Interface;how is the interface to design these kinds of things.
Usability and User Interface;I guess we could do it as a hit map for the road in visualization mode
Usability and User Interface;I mean having a selection is probably makes it a bit more usable so I agree
Usability and User Interface;it would also be always given indirectly. It takes less work for the editing, you can easily just draw the lines and each time you would have here endpoints an intersections which are all calculated automatically and then by selecting an intersection you could describe the movement of an intersection, which is a more advanced algorithm to relayout the whole thing.
Usability and User Interface;Okay so I do it on the bottom, letís say we have here a big picture and I guess in the middle we would have something like the edit area, where everything is also shown. Then on the left side we have some kind ofÖ What can be used? Itís just roads.. roads, roads, roads.
Usability and User Interface;Okay, because then I currently see just one item which is the road as the drawing item and we would have some kind of property window
Usability and User Interface;Roads and intersections and potentially cars, traffic models, all that stuff
Usability and User Interface;So I guess the use case here would be your drawing, a bunch of roads, you automatically get intersections and when you click on a road or an intersection you get this property view where you can select if itís a road you selected.
Usability and User Interface;we could do just a mock up if you like
Use Case; So if we take this example and you just want to move this intersection over here instead. You have a road going out there, and another one going there, and another one going there. 
Use Case; visualization aspect that at the end based on the traffic we will have specific cars and each car can be selected individually and followed for a nice representation.
Use Case;.. You want to describe this as a use case saying okay the user can add roads, he can add traffic or reuse traffic and maybe, or what was it? Reuse traffic? And the timing behavior. And he can visualize the traffic
Use Case;And each time you identify an intersection, this intersection is created automatically
Use Case;And if the map is changing in a way that you add another intersection in between the appearances of roads are recalculated, but this then is a letís say more complex part and you need to copy the attributes and so on so it shouldnít be so difficult
Use Case;And then another line is drawn. Which is another road and this is just stored in the information that each road has always these end points and then you can have a very easy geometrical analysis just calculating the intersection between lines
Use Case;Letís say you are in editor mode in the map and you want to move an intersection or something like that. Then moving that intersection would be very complicated, because you would have to take into account how the roads were drawn initially and so on.
Use Case;Now you enter an additional in between item, which is the road endpoint
Use Case;only thing you can do would be drawing roads.
Use Case;So I guess the use case here would be your drawing, a bunch of roads, you automatically get intersections and when you click on a road or an intersection you get this property view where you can select if itís a road you selected.
Use Case;So letís say from the design we just look on the map creation and somebody says okay Iím adding a road, just draws the line
Use Case;So the map at all I donít know how much details we have, but itís just the surrounding and base don that you can add roads
Use Case;So then you could follow an individual car how it goes through the map and then the simulation of every car that would be the traffic model with a density for a single road and so on.
Use Case;Then you can see, start point, end point, so itís just geometrically representing a line
Use Case;We start with the plane map without any roads and then we can add some

Appreciation;Yes, you too, thank you very much. It was fun.
Argue; But I mean having a selection is probably makes it
Argue; But is that? 
Argue; I agree on that
Argue; I donít see this specifically in the requirements
Argue; I mean it could be one or two I guess
Argue; I thought it would be different, but I guess this would also be fine
Argue; itís not stated there, but we think it would be useful
Argue; So I guess density is not enough
Argue;Ö I donít understand
Argue;Ah okay, you say this is some kind of, yeah, but this could be possible in both cases
Argue;And then we had the road endpoint which could either be a real endpoint or it could be an intersection
Argue;And this I guess is easier than doing the same logic and afterwards subdividing the roads always
Argue;And through the road endpoint it has one, two, four, Ö is possible, fourteen is not good
Argue;and we either have a real intersection or we have an end point
Argue;but also for calculating statistics
Argue;But first maybe we can discuss how to, whatís the best way to define the problem in itself
Argue;but how
Argue;but I assume roads will also be a form of association
Argue;but I donít know
Argue;but I would assume
Argue;but if you say map is our starting point and everything is connected to this by association or something like that would be fine for me. 
Argue;but itís just the surrounding 
Argue;But maybe first
Argue;but the overall implementation should be able to work with more roads or less.
Argue;but then again how would you declare
Argue;but we want to say if we make a throughput through the system via endpoints we would have traffic on endpoints
Argue;But why do I want to move the intersection?
Argue;But why donít we have a traffic model per se? 
Argue;But would traffic class in that case, does it make sense to have the relation to the road itself
Argue;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Argue;Do we want to make it easy and just have density as part of the road or do we want to make something more sophisticated in terms of traffic models.
Argue;donít know per what
Argue;For me it maybe doesnít make sense to have this as a specific intersection, maybe there we would have something different which is a kind of road entry or road exit
Argue;I asked if that is what you wanted, but it sounds like it was not
Argue;I donít know how much details we have
Argue;I donít know how to call it but we can also use it to influence the traffic from outside, which could be something specific
Argue;I donít know.
Argue;I mean another alternative would be to just have something like a default timing which you can change
Argue;I mean if we view a road that is the whole thing, the whole map, I mean it could have multiple intersections,
Argue;I would say both is good. I think default timing should also be available or which is always given and then you can define which default timing can be used.
Argue;Iím just thinking not only from a visualization perspective but also from a simulation perspective
Argue;Iím not so sure about that
Argue;Iím not sure
Argue;Iím not sure
Argue;Iím not sure what you mean by subset
Argue;If later on we have something not just four way but with this T-crossing, then we should easily be able to support this
Argue;if the map is changing in a way that you add another intersection in between the appearances of roads are recalculated, but this then is a letís say more complex part and you need to copy the attributes and so on so it shouldnít be so difficult
Argue;If the system is working, then additional things will be requested and itís better to have it already separated instead of putting all in one class
Argue;If the traffic model should be completely separate entity here, which relates to the map or if we should just make it easier just make the roads have a simple density.
Argue;if we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization in some sense 
Argue;If we want to make it more advanced in the future like you said with the more detailed definition of traffic for which kind of cars and so on we already have the right entry 
Argue;if we want to take the five we can make it even easier and say that roads have a single attribute saying density or something like that
Argue;If you follow the assignment I mean there is specifically mentioned traffic density for the roads, but then it wonít be as easy to calculate something like system throughput or anything like that so it could also be hard to simulate letís say the time it takes for a single car from point A to point B
Argue;if you move the intersection the road will become longer so I guess the velocity will have a different impact on the total throughput.
Argue;if you want to evaluate traffic, evaluate the performance of the traffic lights as a system itself
Argue;It could be open ended, it could be, I guess anything. A house or something
Argue;Itís not specifically defined but the purpose
Argue;Letís say you are in editor mode in the map and you want to move an intersection or something like that. Then moving that intersection would be very complicated, because you would have to take into account how the roads were drawn initially and so on.
Argue;Maybe I miss something right now but these are for my feelings the things we could represent in the class model.
Argue;mean if you only have one visual element then there is no point for it
Argue;Of course we can represent this here but we should also keep in mind that this could be changed in the future and that we should design the system that is able to change this.
Argue;So four
Argue;So if it comes to density I would add the traffic item not just having a description on the road, because I guess in which direction you are going, you want to have it more advanced and if we are starting the system these kinds of requirements will come
Argue;So if we donít have any traffic model per se we are only talking about how much density there is on a single road
Argue;So if we take this example and you just want to move this intersection over here instead. You have a road going out there, and another one going there, and another one going there. 
Argue;So itís clear that there could be not any more than four way intersections
Argue;So itís stated that it is related to the intersection, not to the road.
Argue;so then if I add a third road, then I would have this
Argue;So then you could follow an individual car how it goes through the map and then the simulation of every car that would be the traffic model with a density for a single road and so on.
Argue;So traffic light behavior can be defined
Argue;So we have to choose, one of them has to be open ended so to speak.
Argue;So you have the road endpoint, okay, and therefore we have, what was it? The road has two endpoints
Argue;T could be either a real endpoint or an intersection 
Argue;This makes the calculation more complicated, but on the other hand itís something like if we donít want to design or define traffic per road which is one of the tasks or requirements. 
Argue;traffic is not visualized really, and we could also have a visualization of the traffic, could make sense
Argue;we donít have I mean the visualization for it and Iím not sure how we should. 
Argue;we should have both
Argue;Yes, either a road or intersection. You can see the details.
Argue;You are right, based on the current things it doesnít make too much sense that you have this reuse of traffic
Assert;I donít see anything.
Assumption; I think about it I would also prefer to say road is something that is always between two intersections
Assumption; I think the sensors are on the road rather connecting the intersections rather than on the intersection 
Assumption; mean if thatís the case the traffic class would not translate very well to this global view of traffic
Assumption; per road or in general 
Assumption; We canít have an open ended intersections or open ended roads. 
Assumption;, I guess it doesnít really matter, but I mean if you move the intersection the road will become longer so I guess the velocity will have a different impact on the total throughput.
Assumption;a road has just two intersections
Assumption;And then we had the road endpoint which could either be a real endpoint or it could be an intersection
Assumption;Assuming every road is connected to two intersections
Assumption;Four traffic light at each intersection
Assumption;I donít know how to call it but we can also use it to influence the traffic from outside, which could be something specific
Assumption;I guess there should be some statistics in terms of like the total throughput of the system or something like that. Runtime statistics
Assumption;I mean endpoints wonít have traffic lights.
Assumption;I mean if we view a road that is the whole thing, the whole map, I mean it could have multiple intersections,
Assumption;I mean the naÔve way to go about it would just start with a map and then assume that everything is a subset of a map.
Assumption;I mean they should contain information like density and optionally it may have speed limits and so on.
Assumption;I think you could assign one timing behavior to different traffic lights, 
Assumption;I wanted to say that there is a traffic light at each intersection
Assumption;Iím just clarifying that there should be four traffic lights for each intersection, not a single one.
Assumption;In here we have road one and road two, which I this one. Or you can go to the other side and say okay, if I detect an intersection here, here is road one, here is road two, here is road three and four
Assumption;Is a road always that ending at an intersection or is a road like the designer when he starts to design the map, like I did right now?
Assumption;Maybe we should clarify that and say that there should be one traffic light at each entry point into the intersection
Assumption;Maybe we should clarify that each entry point into the intersection
Assumption;Maybe you want to calculate exactly how long it takes for a single car to go from one end to the other end of the map or something like that
Assumption;Okay itís always 4-way, it needs to be four traffic lights.
Assumption;Right now itís that roads are part of it, we have intersections, traffic will be there, traffic lights
Assumption;Should we also include the velocity, the speed limits of the cars
Assumption;So I guess the visual map is to replay the simulation and the road layout is to create new simulations
Assumption;So I would expect some overall either 2-D or 3-D visualization where you can directly create your traffics and then you could push some button on saying simulate and maybe during the simulation at runtime you can also change some parts, like changing the traffic density, velocity or the traffic light behavior.
Assumption;So if we donít have any traffic model per se we are only talking about how much density there is on a single road
Assumption;so visual map would be houses and the cars travelling on the road and so on
Assumption;the next one was: there are optional sensors for car detection.
Assumption;The speed limit should be the extra thing, itís not really necessary if we are only looking at road density.
Assumption;then the timing scheme. I guess there needs to be a timer for
Assumption;There is a traffic light at each intersection.
Assumption;These Intersections are always 4-way and in there.
Assumption;these roads can have intersections,
Assumption;This is something where just one line is defined and the road can have multiple intersections.
Assumption;visual map of the area, a road layout
Assumption;we also need to look at how fast the cars are while crossing each intersection.
Assumption;we have now described and also making the road layout is something you would also do on the visualization
Assumption;we need a visual map
Assumption;you can either say for the whole intersection there are sensors
Assumption;you should hopefully be able to see what the throughput is.
Awareness; Is this blue now or is this black now?
Awareness; which zoom level do we use? 
Awareness;, I was just trying to figure out where I wanted the 
Awareness;Are we too large now?
Awareness;Are you drawing the interface?
Awareness;Can you see what I am writing
Awareness;Did you draw it?
Awareness;Did you remove it? Okay
Awareness;Have you seen what Iím drawing on my side?
Awareness;I donít know.
Awareness;I zoom out a bit, I try to select 
Awareness;Is that big enough?
Awareness;Itís blue on this side.
Awareness;No it just popped up. I donít know where it came from, even in the wrong color.
Awareness;Not yet
Awareness;now I see
Awareness;Okay so I have a straight diagonal line
Awareness;On the right top, maybe you just zoom out a bit?
Awareness;So I delete it, because itís too close to the other part.
Awareness;What are you drawing now?
Awareness;what was that?
Awareness;where did you write?
Awareness;Yes I can read it
Awareness;You can read it?
Awareness;you see my line?
Awareness;You see what Iíve marked here
Clarification;Ah road density or traffic density?
Clarification;By moving the intersection you mean also changing the geometrical appearance of the roads?
Clarification;do you just want to be able to design the traffic for one of the parts?
Clarification;do you want to only be able to design the overall thing, which then would be an issue regarding the traffic
Clarification;Is a road always that ending at an intersection or is a road like the designer when he starts to design the map, like I did right now?
Clarification;Is it the traffic of the whole system or the traffic of a single road
Clarification;So whatís the difference between the visual map and the rad layout
Clarification;So you just mean the attributes regarding sensor and the assigned traffic lights and traffic behavior?
Clarification;What do you mean bigger level?
Clarification;What do you mean by moving the intersection?
Clarification;What do you want to say?
Clarification;what is the traffic class actually representing
Clarification;What were you thinking?
Clarification;Why what? The part I donít get is why we donít have traffic density.
Clarification;yes, I mean my main point is what would be part of that view?
Clarification;You mean attributes describing the geometrical positioning of everything?
Conciliate;Ah okay, you say this is some kind of, yeah, but this could be possible in both cases
Conciliate;I would say both is good. I think default timing should also be available or which is always given and then you can define which default timing can be used.
Conciliate;Iím just thinking not only from a visualization perspective but also from a simulation perspective
Conciliate;we should have both
Conciliate;Yes, either a road or intersection. You can see the details.
Coordinate Group Process; guess we are also finished regarding the time, I guess we can stop here.
Coordinate Group Process; I guess we can just restart
Coordinate Group Process; I mean best we have 20 minutes.
Coordinate Group Process; It could be some kind of traffic connected but we can also just leave it for now
Coordinate Group Process; Maybe we can remove it afterwards for other discussions?
Coordinate Group Process; say okay we do a different tree on the right side which is just the overall items and these could be specific items which are road. 
Coordinate Group Process; Should we go lower again and restart from the beginning, I donít think itís too difficult.
Coordinate Group Process;Ah okay, we have some time left. Thirty minutes, okay
Coordinate Group Process;but I just mark it blue to say we think it would be useful and should we go in this direction but to make a clear difference to what was our initial purpose regarding the requirements
Coordinate Group Process;But I would make a statement like, what is it, zoom out, view and the model ad in between there should be some kind of controller, I put it here.
Coordinate Group Process;but it really relates to exactly how ambitious we are
Coordinate Group Process;But this should be something we keep in mind saying thatÖ maybe I can write it here that this needs to be recalculated
Coordinate Group Process;Do we have other items we are currently missing?
Coordinate Group Process;How longÖ should we do this  to 10.30?
Coordinate Group Process;How much time is left? 10.30?
Coordinate Group Process;I can also do it in blue as it is not part of the requirements.
Coordinate Group Process;I think, I mean from the mental point of view I mean we are more or less done even if we define the controller and some use cases itís more boiler plate type of things.
Coordinate Group Process;I will draw traffic, traffic light and traffic light behavior in parallel
Coordinate Group Process;I would say itís too much, we donít get this done in time.
Coordinate Group Process;later on we could also have this for the purposes you have described that all the attributes of the car like length or speed could influence the traffic at all.
Coordinate Group Process;maybe for now itís fine in that way.
Coordinate Group Process;Maybe thatís also something that we cannot design right now in time
Coordinate Group Process;Maybe we check again the requirements, just go maybe through what we have or if we have everything. 
Coordinate Group Process;Not that I can think of, maybe we can read the requirements again.
Coordinate Group Process;Now we can move it.
Coordinate Group Process;Okay then maybe letís check again the requirements
Coordinate Group Process;so itís currently maybe a question how much is really necessary
Coordinate Group Process;so maybe we draw this and then we make a component diagram sketch on saying which items we would put together and thatís it 
Coordinate Group Process;so maybe you start to do something and then I will continue that
Coordinate Group Process;suspect we are going to have a lot of use cases, not sure we have the time for that.
Coordinate Group Process;Then I will remove it again
Coordinate Group Process;This is also why I would do this in blue meaning this could also be an additional information
Coordinate Group Process;This is where Iím thinking about kind of which view we should have on this, 
Coordinate Group Process;What is the next? 
Coordinate Group Process;What was the timing? How much time is left for the design phase? (asking Andreas) Who?
Coordinate Group Process;Yes I would say letís start easy and we can add additional things later on
Design Principle;model-view-controller pattern 
Design Principle;Then we have the model, we have the view, but we donít have the controller
Design Principle;we have a statement that we do model view controller pattern
Disagree; I donít see this specifically in the requirements
Disagree;For me it maybe doesnít make sense to have this as a specific intersection, maybe there we would have something different which is a kind of road entry or road exit
Doubt;Ö I donít understand
Doubt;but I donít know
Doubt;donít know per what
Doubt;I donít know how much details we have
Doubt;I donít know.
Doubt;Iím not so sure about that
Doubt;Iím not sure
Doubt;Iím not sure
Doubt;Iím not sure what you mean by subset
Doubt;we donít have I mean the visualization for it and Iím not sure how we should. 
Driver; a bit more usable so I agree
Driver; advanced in the future 
Driver; And then the point could be I guess for future could define anything
Driver;it would also be always given indirectly. It takes less work for the editing, you can easily just draw the lines and each time you would have here endpoints an intersections which are all calculated automatically and then by selecting an intersection you could describe the movement of an intersection, which is a more advanced algorithm to relayout the whole thing.
Driver;Of course we can represent this here but we should also keep in mind that this could be changed in the future and that we should design the system that is able to change this.
Driver;so I see a reuse potential there
Driver;Yes I would keep the traffic class also for reuse purposes
Elaborate;what did I say? ìRoad endpointsî, four and one. Then we would have ìroadî
Elaboration; do you have a better statement? 
Elaboration;I mean what are the types of metrics that we want to have in percent?
Encourage;I think itís a good and great idea
Encourage;Thatís a good point
Encourage;Yes I agree. Great
Encourage;Yes thatís a good idea.
Encourage;Yes, I think itís a good idea
Explain and Clarify;. You would have some kind of patterns for traffic lights, different ones which you will use on different intersections
Explain and Clarify;at least a starting point and end point
Explain and Clarify;for me itís the traffic on a single road
Explain and Clarify;From my understanding it was like for the for the designer yes, the designer of the traffic just wants to define traffic either on the road or as input output for the system on endpoints, 
Explain and Clarify;I guess it relates to if we should do this system level simulation or not, otherwise it doesnít make sense to have it.
Explain and Clarify;I mean if we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization in some sense so that the visualization part would be, would have the play buttons and the simulations and all of that.
Explain and Clarify;I mean if you have an open ended road you should somehow be able to define that only one end should have an intersection and the other one should have not
Explain and Clarify;Iím just clarifying that there should be four traffic lights for each intersection, not a single one.
Explain and Clarify;mean we send it to be part of the intersection
Explain and Clarify;Now I have another road and here is my first intersection. And now Iím adding another road and here I have another intersection
Explain and Clarify;the first thing is only that everything is layouted. It could be also both but this is more detailed meaning that in this visual map. So the map at all I donít know how much details we have, but itís just the surrounding and base don that you can add roads.
Implementation Decision;And not the primitive type that was essentially
Implementation Decision;but the overall implementation should be able to work with more roads or less.
Implementation Decision;for now we donít have any attributes for the endpoint
Implementation Decision;in there, there is a Boolean attribute indicating the sensors are available.
Implementation Decision;is it an attribute for the road?
Implementation Decision;so letís add an interface then
Implementation Decision;So we do some kind of extra class or interface for intersection 
Implementation Decision;the name for the interface
Infer; So I guess density is not enough
Infer;And this I guess is easier than doing the same logic and afterwards subdividing the roads always
Infer;Letís say you are in editor mode in the map and you want to move an intersection or something like that. Then moving that intersection would be very complicated, because you would have to take into account how the roads were drawn initially and so on.
Infer;So four
Infer;So if it comes to density I would add the traffic item not just having a description on the road, because I guess in which direction you are going, you want to have it more advanced and if we are starting the system these kinds of requirements will come
Infer;So if we take this example and you just want to move this intersection over here instead. You have a road going out there, and another one going there, and another one going there. 
Infer;So itís clear that there could be not any more than four way intersections
Infer;So itís stated that it is related to the intersection, not to the road.
Infer;So then you could follow an individual car how it goes through the map and then the simulation of every car that would be the traffic model with a density for a single road and so on.
Infer;So traffic light behavior can be defined
Infer;So you have the road endpoint, okay, and therefore we have, what was it? The road has two endpoints
Inform; I guess should be to have a look at congestion and see how many cars can actually get through during a certain amount of time
Inform; I guess there needs to be a timer for
Inform; I have traffic density can be changed.
Inform; I think itís useful, 
Inform; I think the sensors are on the road rather connecting the intersections rather than on the intersection 
Inform; it could be that this is roads specific
Inform;. You would have some kind of patterns for traffic lights, different ones which you will use on different intersections
Inform;Ah okay, road. We would have roads
Inform;Although for roads it would be a bit more tricky because I mean if we zoom in the sign that every road has two intersections, it doesnít fit, because at the edges of the map we have to have something else.
Inform;at least a starting point and end point
Inform;for me itís the traffic on a single road
Inform;From my understanding it was like for the for the designer yes, the designer of the traffic just wants to define traffic either on the road or as input output for the system on endpoints, 
Inform;I donít see anything.
Inform;I donít think that you want to redefine it for each intersection again and again if the timing is the same
Inform;I guess it relates to if we should do this system level simulation or not, otherwise it doesnít make sense to have it.
Inform;I guess the map can stay there
Inform;I guess there should be some statistics in terms of like the total throughput of the system or something like that. Runtime statistics
Inform;I guess this four is representing what is required right now
Inform;I guess timing behavior would be something in relation to traffic lights
Inform;I guess we could do it as a hit map for the road in visualization mode
Inform;I mean if we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization in some sense so that the visualization part would be, would have the play buttons and the simulations and all of that.
Inform;I mean if you have an open ended road you should somehow be able to define that only one end should have an intersection and the other one should have not
Inform;I mean the combination of possible roads would become a combinatorial exploration
Inform;I mean the naÔve way to go about it would just start with a map and then assume that everything is a subset of a map.
Inform;I mean they should contain information like density and optionally it may have speed limits and so on.
Inform;I think we should then move to stages sooner or later
Inform;I would like to use the abstraction level we have here at the requirement level
Inform;I would say we have a visual item and that could be either road or traffic light or car
Inform;Iím just clarifying that there should be four traffic lights for each intersection, not a single one.
Inform;Iím just thinking about the different other possible use cases.
Inform;It is: Behavior can be defined at each intersection
Inform;it would be road property I think
Inform;Maybe we can also move it. Maybe itís possible, I can try
Inform;maybe we donít even need a tool box
Inform;maybe we just keep this in mind and then itís fine
Inform;Maybe we should clarify that and say that there should be one traffic light at each entry point into the intersection
Inform;Maybe we should clarify that each entry point into the intersection
Inform;Maybe you want to calculate exactly how long it takes for a single car to go from one end to the other end of the map or something like that
Inform;mean we send it to be part of the intersection
Inform;Now I have another road and here is my first intersection. And now Iím adding another road and here I have another intersection
Inform;Should we also include the velocity, the speed limits of the cars
Inform;So I guess the visual map is to replay the simulation and the road layout is to create new simulations
Inform;So I would expect some overall either 2-D or 3-D visualization where you can directly create your traffics and then you could push some button on saying simulate and maybe during the simulation at runtime you can also change some parts, like changing the traffic density, velocity or the traffic light behavior.
Inform;So what I would like to have is some kind of traffic library
Inform;Speed limit I would say rather
Inform;Thatís just to kind of make it visually appealing in the map mode. 
Inform;The first one was for me that we need a visual map
Inform;the first thing is only that everything is layouted. It could be also both but this is more detailed meaning that in this visual map. So the map at all I donít know how much details we have, but itís just the surrounding and base don that you can add roads.
Inform;The timing behavior would be something related to traffic lights.
Inform;then the next one was: there are optional sensors for car detection.
Inform;There seems to be two moves
Inform;This is a road. I added a road to the system
Inform;to the roads, not the intersections
Inform;we also need to look at how fast the cars are while crossing each intersection.
Inform;We canít have an open ended intersections or open ended roads. 
Inform;We could do such a thing
Inform;we could either now think about some technical aspects meaning for the visualization on the letís say more component diagram level which items do we need or maybe first of all we maybe make a class diagram for the different items, which should be represented by the software referencing to the requirements
Inform;We could have some kind of input traffic, but the traffic is already designed per road
Inform;we just use this part as a new road and this part as a new road
Inform;We start with the plane map without any roads and then we can add some. 
Inform;what did I say? ìRoad endpointsî, four and one. Then we would have ìroadî
Inform;Yes maybe road traffic
Inform;Yes, how much in detail thatís something we can discuss
Inform;You have the speed limit of the roads, but then also the velocity of the cars
Inform;you should hopefully be able to see what the throughput is.
Information; do we have something in vision
Information;Are you writing anything right now?
Information;do you have other points regarding what you can design on the map? 
Information;Do you have something else?
Information;how do we continue based on that?
Information;how do you know where one road starts and where one ends?
Information;Is this something which is defined in the task or do you think itís just optional we could add it?
Information;Okay, so visual map would be houses and the cars travelling on the road and so on?
Information;so what was the question? 
Information;the only thing that is actually set is the density per road what would that view contain?
Information;The question is what do you want to do as a designer?
Information;the question is what is a road? 
Information;What is it?
Information;What more do we have as part of the intersection? 
Information;what was it
Information;What was it? 
Information;what was your point? 
Information;where did you write?
Information;Yes, so anything else?
Information;You asked if we have another attribute for intersection?
Information;You mean each traffic light?
Justification;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Justification;Is it currently disturbing
Justification;Is it mentioned in the task or do you just think it would be useful?
Justify;I guess this four is representing what is required right now
Justify;Iím just thinking about the different other possible use cases.
Justify;maybe we donít even need a tool box
Justify;Thatís just to kind of make it visually appealing in the map mode. 
Justify;we just use this part as a new road and this part as a new road
Lead; I guess should be to have a look at congestion and see how many cars can actually get through during a certain amount of time
Lead; I have traffic density can be changed.
Lead;Ah okay, road. We would have roads
Lead;Although for roads it would be a bit more tricky because I mean if we zoom in the sign that every road has two intersections, it doesnít fit, because at the edges of the map we have to have something else.
Lead;I donít think that you want to redefine it for each intersection again and again if the timing is the same
Lead;I guess we could do it as a hit map for the road in visualization mode
Lead;I think we should then move to stages sooner or later
Lead;I would like to use the abstraction level we have here at the requirement level
Lead;It is: Behavior can be defined at each intersection
Lead;So I guess the visual map is to replay the simulation and the road layout is to create new simulations
Lead;So I would expect some overall either 2-D or 3-D visualization where you can directly create your traffics and then you could push some button on saying simulate and maybe during the simulation at runtime you can also change some parts, like changing the traffic density, velocity or the traffic light behavior.
Lead;So what I would like to have is some kind of traffic library
Lead;Speed limit I would say rather
Lead;The first one was for me that we need a visual map
Lead;then the next one was: there are optional sensors for car detection.
Lead;There seems to be two moves
Lead;This is a road. I added a road to the system
Lead;we also need to look at how fast the cars are while crossing each intersection.
Lead;We canít have an open ended intersections or open ended roads. 
Lead;we could either now think about some technical aspects meaning for the visualization on the letís say more component diagram level which items do we need or maybe first of all we maybe make a class diagram for the different items, which should be represented by the software referencing to the requirements
Lead;We start with the plane map without any roads and then we can add some. 
Lead;You have the speed limit of the roads, but then also the velocity of the cars
Lead;you should hopefully be able to see what the throughput is.
Maintenance; Does that fit to you view as well?
Maintenance;A sketch for the interface?
Maintenance;again sorry for my handwriting
Maintenance;Ah sorry
Maintenance;But we have the roads.
Maintenance;Did you remove it?
Maintenance;Do you understand my point?
Maintenance;do you want to do it or should I continue?
Maintenance;Do you want to model as use case?
Maintenance;Have you seen what Iím drawing on my side?
Maintenance;How much time is left? 10.30?
Maintenance;Huh? Road Traffic? 
Maintenance;I start with a map?
Maintenance;Iím sorry about my handwriting 
Maintenance;Is it okay in that state?
Maintenance;is it okay?
Maintenance;Is my handwriting okay? 
Maintenance;Is that big enough?
Maintenance;is that okay?
Maintenance;Is that okay?
Maintenance;Maybe just call it tool box or something like that
Maintenance;Really? 
Maintenance;Remove everything
Maintenance;right
Maintenance;right
Maintenance;right? 
Maintenance;right?
Maintenance;right? 
Maintenance;right?
Maintenance;right?
Maintenance;right?
Maintenance;right?
Maintenance;right? 
Maintenance;right? 
Maintenance;right?
Maintenance;right? 
Maintenance;right? Is that correct?
Maintenance;Should I start?
Maintenance;Should we do a drawing for that or
Maintenance;Should we draw it in detail or do we just make a statement on what we have, what needs to be visualized, the roads, the traffic lights and the cars
Maintenance;Sorry
Maintenance;Sorry for my handwriting
Maintenance;Sorry I have
Maintenance;Sorry.
Maintenance;Sorry?
Maintenance;That will be the timing scheme?
Maintenance;Then I remove the drawings of the roads?
Maintenance;we could do just a mock up if you like
Maintenance;What am I doing wrong? 
Maintenance;which is if we go to the visual item and have the map is okay, isnít it?
Maintenance;Why we move the intersection you mean?
Maintenance;Would that be okay?
Maintenance;You can read it?
Maintenance;You mean each traffic light?
Maintenance;you see my line?
Maintenance;You want me to try? Okay
Motivate; should make it much easier, youíre right
Motivate;Alright, yes, sure
Motivate;Fair enough.
Motivate;I think itís a good and great idea
Motivate;I think itís a good idea
Motivate;Same thing here
Motivate;So I usually start with a data model, so a class diagram is probably a good idea
Motivate;Sure.
Motivate;Thatís a good point
Motivate;Thatís fine
Motivate;We need to do one of the representations meaning thatÖ I mean you are right on the loose ends, I agree on that
Motivate;Yes I agree. Great
Motivate;Yes thatís a good idea.
Motivate;Yes thatís fine.
Motivate;Yes, for sure
Motivate;Yes, I think itís a good idea
Motivate;you are right
Notation Decision;Ö we should have some description on how is the interaction with the system which you could also do via use case,
Notation Decision;do we also go on some behavioral aspects
Notation Decision;letís say more component diagram level 
Notation Decision;maybe first of all we maybe make a class diagram 
Notation Decision;maybe we draw this and then we make a component diagram sketch 
Notation Decision;So I usually start with a data model, so a class diagram is probably a good idea
Notation Decision;some use cases or something like that
Offer Alternative; I mean it could be one or two I guess
Offer Alternative;And then we had the road endpoint which could either be a real endpoint or it could be an intersection
Offer Alternative;And through the road endpoint it has one, two, four, Ö is possible, fourteen is not good
Offer Alternative;and we either have a real intersection or we have an end point
Offer Alternative;Do we want to make it easy and just have density as part of the road or do we want to make something more sophisticated in terms of traffic models.
Offer Alternative;I mean another alternative would be to just have something like a default timing which you can change
Offer Alternative;If the traffic model should be completely separate entity here, which relates to the map or if we should just make it easier just make the roads have a simple density.
Offer Alternative;It could be open ended, it could be, I guess anything. A house or something
Offer Alternative;So we have to choose, one of them has to be open ended so to speak.
Offer Alternative;T could be either a real endpoint or an intersection 
Offer Alternative;This makes the calculation more complicated, but on the other hand itís something like if we donít want to design or define traffic per road which is one of the tasks or requirements. 
Opinion; is there a speed limit of the road or the actual velocity of the car going through the road because that might not be the same
Opinion; Is there something in addition we want to have
Opinion;And how are those most easily calculated?
Opinion;did I misinterpret that
Opinion;How do we want the relations to be?
Opinion;In the middle?
Opinion;itís okay if I add density to the traffic?
Opinion;One traffic light should have a single intersection, right?
Opinion;Or is there something specific which we would like to have on endpoints
Opinion;Road endpoint, maybe?
Opinion;Shoud I call it single traffic, road traffic , specific traffic,
Opinion;Should it be on a bigger level?
Opinion;Should it be on a kind of big level or is it sufficient to just have a number of intersections with roads connecting them in terms of class relationships I mean.
Opinion;Should we do a drawing for that 
Opinion;Would that not be a property of the intersection?
Propose Exception; But I mean having a selection is probably makes it
Propose Exception; But is that? 
Propose Exception; I thought it would be different, but I guess this would also be fine
Propose Exception; itís not stated there, but we think it would be useful
Propose Exception;but also for calculating statistics
Propose Exception;But first maybe we can discuss how to, whatís the best way to define the problem in itself
Propose Exception;but how
Propose Exception;but I assume roads will also be a form of association
Propose Exception;but I would assume
Propose Exception;but if you say map is our starting point and everything is connected to this by association or something like that would be fine for me. 
Propose Exception;but itís just the surrounding 
Propose Exception;But maybe first
Propose Exception;but the overall implementation should be able to work with more roads or less.
Propose Exception;but then again how would you declare
Propose Exception;but we want to say if we make a throughput through the system via endpoints we would have traffic on endpoints
Propose Exception;But why do I want to move the intersection?
Propose Exception;But why donít we have a traffic model per se? 
Propose Exception;But would traffic class in that case, does it make sense to have the relation to the road itself
Propose Exception;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Propose Exception;I asked if that is what you wanted, but it sounds like it was not
Propose Exception;I donít know how to call it but we can also use it to influence the traffic from outside, which could be something specific
Propose Exception;Itís not specifically defined but the purpose
Propose Exception;Maybe I miss something right now but these are for my feelings the things we could represent in the class model.
Propose Exception;Of course we can represent this here but we should also keep in mind that this could be changed in the future and that we should design the system that is able to change this.
Reinforce; should make it much easier, youíre right
Reinforce;Alright, yes, sure
Reinforce;Fair enough.
Reinforce;I think itís a good idea
Reinforce;Same thing here
Reinforce;So I usually start with a data model, so a class diagram is probably a good idea
Reinforce;Sure.
Reinforce;Thatís fine
Reinforce;We need to do one of the representations meaning thatÖ I mean you are right on the loose ends, I agree on that
Reinforce;Yes thatís fine.
Reinforce;Yes, for sure
Reinforce;you are right
Reject;Ah no
Reject;No
Reject;No
Reject;no
Request; do we have something in vision
Request; do you have a better statement? 
Request; is there a speed limit of the road or the actual velocity of the car going through the road because that might not be the same
Request; Is there something in addition we want to have
Request;Ah road density or traffic density?
Request;And how are those most easily calculated?
Request;Are you writing anything right now?
Request;By moving the intersection you mean also changing the geometrical appearance of the roads?
Request;did I misinterpret that
Request;do we really have an actual intersection as an item or is it just indirectly given if you do an intersection?
Request;do you have other points regarding what you can design on the map? 
Request;Do you have something else?
Request;do you just want to be able to design the traffic for one of the parts?
Request;do you want to only be able to design the overall thing, which then would be an issue regarding the traffic
Request;how do we continue based on that?
Request;How do we want the relations to be?
Request;how do you know where one road starts and where one ends?
Request;I mean what are the types of metrics that we want to have in percent?
Request;In the middle?
Request;Is a road always that ending at an intersection or is a road like the designer when he starts to design the map, like I did right now?
Request;Is it currently disturbing
Request;Is it mentioned in the task or do you just think it would be useful?
Request;Is it the traffic of the whole system or the traffic of a single road
Request;Is this something which is defined in the task or do you think itís just optional we could add it?
Request;itís okay if I add density to the traffic?

Request;Should we do a drawing for that 
Request;so what was the question? 
Request;So whatís the difference between the visual map and the rad layout
Request;So you just mean the attributes regarding sensor and the assigned traffic lights and traffic behavior?
Request;the only thing that is actually set is the density per road what would that view contain?
Request;The question is what do you want to do as a designer?
Request;the question is what is a road?

Request;What is it?
Request;what is the traffic class actually representing
Request;What more do we have as part of the intersection? 
Request;what was it
Request;What was it? 
Request;what was your point? 
Request;What were you thinking?
Request;where did you write?
Request;Why what? The part I donít get is why we donít have traffic density.
Request;Would that not be a property of the intersection?
Request;yes, I mean my main point is what would be part of that view?
Request;Yes, so anything else?
Request;You asked if we have another attribute for intersection?
Request;You mean attributes describing the geometrical positioning of everything?
Request;You mean each traffic light?
Request Attention;But we have the roads.

Request Confirmation;you see my line?
Request Focus Change;I mean letís take your example here. Let me draw
Request Focus Change;I would take something like blue to highlight something which is currently not directly in the requirements
Scoping;Iím currently not hundred percent sure what also the customer wants and what the budget is and therefore 
Structural Decision; You would have two instances, a starting endpoint, then an ending endpoint, something like that for the interface.
Structural Decision;. So this means we would continue with having roads and a road has always one to two intersections.
Structural Decision;Ah okay, road. We would have roads
Structural Decision;Although for roads it would be a bit more tricky because I mean if we zoom in the sign that every road has two intersections, it doesnít fit, because at the edges of the map we have to have something else.
Structural Decision;And then just have cars associated with the map and road
Structural Decision;And through the road endpoint it has one, two, four, Ö is possible, fourteen is not good
Structural Decision;but I assume roads will also be a form of association
Structural Decision;but we want to say if we make a throughput through the system via endpoints we would have traffic on endpoints
Structural Decision;But would traffic class in that case, does it make sense to have the relation to the road itself
Structural Decision;Do we want to make it easy and just have density as part of the road or do we want to make something more sophisticated in terms of traffic models.
Structural Decision;For me it maybe doesnít make sense to have this as a specific intersection, maybe there we would have something different which is a kind of road entry or road exit
Structural Decision;From my understanding it was like for the for the designer yes, the designer of the traffic just wants to define traffic either on the road or as input output for the system on endpoints, 
Structural Decision;I guess timing behavior would be something in relation to traffic lights
Structural Decision;I mean in the basic, basic view 
Structural Decision;I was talking about this abstract or interface which is just a road endpoint
Structural Decision;If the traffic model should be completely separate entity here, which relates to the map or if we should just make it easier just make the roads have a simple density.
Structural Decision;Is it the traffic of the whole system or the traffic of a single road
Structural Decision;is there a speed limit of the road or the actual velocity of the car going through the road because that might not be the same.
Structural Decision;It should also have traffic lights as an association I guess
Structural Decision;it should be four, or actually it should be two.
Structural Decision;Itís better that we make an overall abstract statement in the time
Structural Decision;later on we could also have this for the purposes you have described that all the attributes of the car like length or speed could influence the traffic at all.
Structural Decision;Maybe I would actually draw traffic as a completely separate entity
Structural Decision;okay, so I put the velocity here.
Structural Decision;one of these is always connected to the road which would be enough. 
Structural Decision;One traffic light should have a single intersection, right?
Structural Decision;Road was for me another class.
Structural Decision;So here it is an intersection with traffic lights, which are from our understanding four, but letís say in general it could be a star
Structural Decision;so I would add a visual item
Structural Decision;So it could also be that intersection is just an subclass of endpoint 
Structural Decision;so this is just internals, maybe we need something more in terms of the visualization.
Structural Decision;the relation between traffic and road like a star, you could have this traffic item in the kind of library and just make it drag and drop to specific roads or endpoints that you can reuse the definition
Structural Decision;the system is working, then additional things will be requested and itís better to have it already separated instead of putting all in one class
Structural Decision;The timing behavior would be something related to traffic lights.
Structural Decision;then we have four of those
Structural Decision;Then we have the model, we have the view, but we donít have the controller
Structural Decision;Traffic here, traffic lights and then we add the timing behavior
Structural Decision;we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization 
Structural Decision;We donít need a traffic class.
Structural Decision;We have a map, some formal map, we have some formal representation of an intersection.
Structural Decision;what is the traffic class actually representing
Structural Decision;Yes I would keep the traffic class also for reuse purposes
Structural Decision;You could also do something like, letís say we have a traffic and this would have the cars with whatever attributes.
Suggest; I guess there needs to be a timer for
Suggest; I think itís useful, 
Suggest; I think the sensors are on the road rather connecting the intersections rather than on the intersection 
Suggest; it could be that this is roads specific
Suggest;I guess the map can stay there
Suggest;I guess there should be some statistics in terms of like the total throughput of the system or something like that. Runtime statistics
Suggest;I guess timing behavior would be something in relation to traffic lights
Suggest;I mean the combination of possible roads would become a combinatorial exploration
Suggest;I mean the naÔve way to go about it would just start with a map and then assume that everything is a subset of a map.
Suggest;I mean they should contain information like density and optionally it may have speed limits and so on.
Suggest;I would say we have a visual item and that could be either road or traffic light or car
Suggest;it would be road property I think
Suggest;Maybe we can also move it. Maybe itís possible, I can try
Suggest;maybe we just keep this in mind and then itís fine
Suggest;Maybe we should clarify that and say that there should be one traffic light at each entry point into the intersection
Suggest;Maybe we should clarify that each entry point into the intersection
Suggest;Maybe you want to calculate exactly how long it takes for a single car to go from one end to the other end of the map or something like that
Suggest;Should we also include the velocity, the speed limits of the cars
Suggest;The timing behavior would be something related to traffic lights.
Suggest;to the roads, not the intersections
Suggest;We could do such a thing
Suggest;We could have some kind of input traffic, but the traffic is already designed per road
Suggest;Yes maybe road traffic
Suggest;Yes, how much in detail thatís something we can discuss
Suggest Action;do you want to do it or should I continue?
Suggest Action;Do you want to model as use case?
Suggest Action;I start with a map?
Suggest Action;Maybe just call it tool box or something like that
Suggest Action;Should we do a drawing for that or
Suggest Action;Should we draw it in detail or do we just make a statement on what we have, what needs to be visualized, the roads, the traffic lights and the cars
Suggest Action;Then I remove the drawings of the roads?
Suggest Action;we could do just a mock up if you like
Suggest Action;You want me to try? Okay
Summarize Information; And you said it would be good to have traffic also visualized, 
Summarize Information;and velocity, yesÖ visualize at one time, light, trafficÖ
Summarize Information;For now we donít have any traffic, right? We have road density.
Summarize Information;If you look on the class diagrams we have these intersections and then we have traffic lights and then we have timing behavior.
Summarize Information;Letís check the other requirements. Ö sensors, okay, traffic can be defined at each intersection, yes. I have promised to read my own writing, traffic density per road, yes okay thatís fine. Velocity, okay, velocity should be one part of the road traffic
Summarize Information;letís say in general we already added in blue some additional attributes for the traffic. There could be more in the future, which could be of importance
Summarize Information;The road layout. So we have the visualization, we have the model, but we donít have talked too much about
Summarize Information;we have all data model, we have the view, we have the sketch
Summarize Information;We have talked about the road layout, we have road intersections in four-way but it could be also supporting more in the future, we have traffic lights at the intersections, optional we have the sensor attribute. Thatís something we have not drawn again, right? So the sensor attribute is road has sensors, right?
Suppose;I mean if we view a road that is the whole thing, the whole map, I mean it could have multiple intersections,
Suppose;If later on we have something not just four way but with this T-crossing, then we should easily be able to support this
Suppose;if the map is changing in a way that you add another intersection in between the appearances of roads are recalculated, but this then is a letís say more complex part and you need to copy the attributes and so on so it shouldnít be so difficult
Suppose;If the system is working, then additional things will be requested and itís better to have it already separated instead of putting all in one class
Suppose;if we are going for a more model-view-controller pattern or something like that maybe we want to separate the visualization in some sense 
Suppose;If we want to make it more advanced in the future like you said with the more detailed definition of traffic for which kind of cars and so on we already have the right entry 
Suppose;if we want to take the five we can make it even easier and say that roads have a single attribute saying density or something like that
Suppose;If you follow the assignment I mean there is specifically mentioned traffic density for the roads, but then it wonít be as easy to calculate something like system throughput or anything like that so it could also be hard to simulate letís say the time it takes for a single car from point A to point B
Suppose;if you move the intersection the road will become longer so I guess the velocity will have a different impact on the total throughput.
Suppose;if you want to evaluate traffic, evaluate the performance of the traffic lights as a system itself
Suppose;mean if you only have one visual element then there is no point for it
Suppose;So if we donít have any traffic model per se we are only talking about how much density there is on a single road
Suppose;so then if I add a third road, then I would have this
Task; And you said it would be good to have traffic also visualized, 
Task; guess we are also finished regarding the time, I guess we can stop here.
Task; I guess we can just restart
Task; I mean best we have 20 minutes.
Task; It could be some kind of traffic connected but we can also just leave it for now
Task; Maybe we can remove it afterwards for other discussions?
Task; say okay we do a different tree on the right side which is just the overall items and these could be specific items which are road. 
Task; Should we go lower again and restart from the beginning, I donít think itís too difficult.
Task;Ah okay, we have some time left. Thirty minutes, okay
Task;and velocity, yesÖ visualize at one time, light, trafficÖ
Task;but I just mark it blue to say we think it would be useful and should we go in this direction but to make a clear difference to what was our initial purpose regarding the requirements
Task;But I would make a statement like, what is it, zoom out, view and the model ad in between there should be some kind of controller, I put it here.
Task;but it really relates to exactly how ambitious we are
Task;But this should be something we keep in mind saying thatÖ maybe I can write it here that this needs to be recalculated
Task;Do we have other items we are currently missing?
Task;For now we donít have any traffic, right? We have road density.
Task;How longÖ should we do this  to 10.30?
Task;How much time is left? 10.30?
Task;I can also do it in blue as it is not part of the requirements.
Task;I mean letís take your example here. Let me draw
Task;I think, I mean from the mental point of view I mean we are more or less done even if we define the controller and some use cases itís more boiler plate type of things.
Task;I will draw traffic, traffic light and traffic light behavior in parallel
Task;I would say itís too much, we donít get this done in time.
Task;I would take something like blue to highlight something which is currently not directly in the requirements
Task;If you look on the class diagrams we have these intersections and then we have traffic lights and then we have timing behavior.
Task;later on we could also have this for the purposes you have described that all the attributes of the car like length or speed could influence the traffic at all.
Task;Letís check the other requirements. Ö sensors, okay, traffic can be defined at each intersection, yes. I have promised to read my own writing, traffic density per road, yes okay thatís fine. Velocity, okay, velocity should be one part of the road traffic
Task;letís say in general we already added in blue some additional attributes for the traffic. There could be more in the future, which could be of importance
Task;maybe for now itís fine in that way.
Task;Maybe thatís also something that we cannot design right now in time
Task;Maybe we check again the requirements, just go maybe through what we have or if we have everything. 
Task;Not that I can think of, maybe we can read the requirements again.
Task;Now we can move it.
Task;Okay then maybe letís check again the requirements
Task;so itís currently maybe a question how much is really necessary
Task;so maybe we draw this and then we make a component diagram sketch on saying which items we would put together and thatís it 
Task;so maybe you start to do something and then I will continue that
Task;suspect we are going to have a lot of use cases, not sure we have the time for that.
Task;The road layout. So we have the visualization, we have the model, but we donít have talked too much about
Task;Then I will remove it again
Task;This is also why I would do this in blue meaning this could also be an additional information
Task;This is where Iím thinking about kind of which view we should have on this, 
Task;we have all data model, we have the view, we have the sketch
Task;We have talked about the road layout, we have road intersections in four-way but it could be also supporting more in the future, we have traffic lights at the intersections, optional we have the sensor attribute. Thatís something we have not drawn again, right? So the sensor attribute is road has sensors, right?
Task;What is the next? 
Task;What was the timing? How much time is left for the design phase? (asking Andreas) Who?
Task;Yes I would say letís start easy and we can add additional things later on
Technical Problem;I cannot write anymore
Technical Problem;I just lost one line, I can add it
Technical Problem;Iím trying but it I not really working
Technical Question; I cantít do anything.
Technical Question;Can I move?
Technical Question;Can you repeat this? What do you want to do?
Technical Question;How can I move? (addressing technical assistant
Technical Question;How can I zoom? 
Technical Question;How longÖ should we do this  to 10.30? (Asking Rodi)
Technical Question;I donít know why. (talking in German to technical assistant) So now I have function again.
Technical Question;I tried to do something in a different color, it didnít work
Technical Question;Iím just thinking of how much time we have.
Technical Question;Iím trying to delete something, butÖ
Technical Question;it depends on you. I you finish before it is ok
Technical Question;it seems like the zoom is panning now instead
Technical Question;Itís starting to have trouble with the rendering, itís slower.
Technical Question;Move the class ting or something like that.
Technical Question;No you cannot move it I think.
Technical Question;Rodi? Is it possible to move a selected painting aroud?
Technical Question;So I can also not highlight something? This cannot be seen on the other part?
Technical Question;That would be a very great feature
Technical Question;think I zoomed out too much so itís starting to have trouble with the
Technical Question;Yes of course, but for now it doesnít work I think.
Usability and User Interface; I would like to have a traffic library where you can do via drag and dropÖ select single descriptions, so single items of traffic and drag and drop it to the intersections
Usability and User Interface; Iím just going to add the statistics window as an extra, down in the visualization
Usability and User Interface;A sketch for the interface?
Usability and User Interface;And I would, maybe another library which is not so optional would be the timing behavior
Usability and User Interface;how is the interface to design these kinds of things.
Usability and User Interface;I guess we could do it as a hit map for the road in visualization mode
Usability and User Interface;I mean having a selection is probably makes it a bit more usable so I agree
Usability and User Interface;it would also be always given indirectly. It takes less work for the editing, you can easily just draw the lines and each time you would have here endpoints an intersections which are all calculated automatically and then by selecting an intersection you could describe the movement of an intersection, which is a more advanced algorithm to relayout the whole thing.
Usability and User Interface;Okay so I do it on the bottom, letís say we have here a big picture and I guess in the middle we would have something like the edit area, where everything is also shown. Then on the left side we have some kind ofÖ What can be used? Itís just roads.. roads, roads, roads.
Usability and User Interface;Okay, because then I currently see just one item which is the road as the drawing item and we would have some kind of property window
Usability and User Interface;Roads and intersections and potentially cars, traffic models, all that stuff
Usability and User Interface;So I guess the use case here would be your drawing, a bunch of roads, you automatically get intersections and when you click on a road or an intersection you get this property view where you can select if itís a road you selected.
Usability and User Interface;we could do just a mock up if you like
Use Case; So if we take this example and you just want to move this intersection over here instead. You have a road going out there, and another one going there, and another one going there. 
Use Case; visualization aspect that at the end based on the traffic we will have specific cars and each car can be selected individually and followed for a nice representation.
Use Case;.. You want to describe this as a use case saying okay the user can add roads, he can add traffic or reuse traffic and maybe, or what was it? Reuse traffic? And the timing behavior. And he can visualize the traffic
Use Case;And each time you identify an intersection, this intersection is created automatically
Use Case;And if the map is changing in a way that you add another intersection in between the appearances of roads are recalculated, but this then is a letís say more complex part and you need to copy the attributes and so on so it shouldnít be so difficult
Use Case;And then another line is drawn. Which is another road and this is just stored in the information that each road has always these end points and then you can have a very easy geometrical analysis just calculating the intersection between lines
Use Case;Letís say you are in editor mode in the map and you want to move an intersection or something like that. Then moving that intersection would be very complicated, because you would have to take into account how the roads were drawn initially and so on.
Use Case;Now you enter an additional in between item, which is the road endpoint
Use Case;only thing you can do would be drawing roads.
Use Case;So I guess the use case here would be your drawing, a bunch of roads, you automatically get intersections and when you click on a road or an intersection you get this property view where you can select if itís a road you selected.
Use Case;So letís say from the design we just look on the map creation and somebody says okay Iím adding a road, just draws the line
Use Case;So the map at all I donít know how much details we have, but itís just the surrounding and base don that you can add roads
Use Case;So then you could follow an individual car how it goes through the map and then the simulation of every car that would be the traffic model with a density for a single road and so on.
Use Case;Then you can see, start point, end point, so itís just geometrically representing a line
Use Case;We start with the plane map without any roads and then we can add some

Agree;Yeah I mean it would be interesting because then you can create more complex pattern and so, or sequences or more than one traffic light.

Apologize;I am sorry for this ugly appearance
Apologize;so I am sorry for that
Apologize;sorry
Apologize;sorry
Argue; but of course also 
Argue; if it was green before, we have to change 
Argue; if we select 
Argue; if we, first time when you draw something and then try to play 
Argue; meant that if we want to detect it automatically we have to say 
Argue;, I am not sure
Argue;Ah, ok because that was something I was just wondering about, whether we should
Argue;am still not sure how to
Argue;And of course the, that I guess, that itís not something that we have to design
Argue;and so, or sequences or more than one traffic 
Argue;anyway, but that the 
Argue;Because otherwise the other cars just need to wait until no more cars actually crossing the traffic light and we need to take this into account.
Argue;Because otherwise this might result in a crash
Argue;because then this might result in an accident
Argue;But
Argue;But does the user need to be able to define in our simplified version?
Argue;But how should that work
Argue;but I am not sure, where
Argue;but I donít know how to easily program that kind of behavior
Argue;but I donít think it is necessary, but I mean that depends 
Argue;but I don't know that's also
Argue;but I mean a very easy way, oh but then you have to rename them
Argue;but I think it might not be very handsome for meaning for the
Argue;but if 
Argue;But of course would increase the complexity of the
Argue;but rather focus 
Argue;but that they reference each other in some way.
Argue;but thatís what I meant with my circles
Argue;but then 
Argue;but then I mean 
Argue;But then I was thinking about how to describe the sequence and 
Argue;but we probably also need to take some delay into account
Argue;can both of them be orange at the same time for example?
Argue;Exactly
Argue;Exactly
Argue;I am not sure
Argue;I am not sure
Argue;I am not sure how to deal with the wave her.
Argue;I didnít take it into account that it says that enters the map on a given road, so but then itís probably better to do like this at the start of the road or at the end of the road,
Argue;I donít know 
Argue;I donít know
Argue;I donít know
Argue;I donít know how to design it
Argue;I donít know, 
Argue;I donít know,
Argue;I donít know.
Argue;I donít think so,
Argue;I mean the easiest way is to just have as you said, timings
Argue;I think so because you should be able to have, you should be able to have intersections with no sensors then the intersections lights should be able to change based on the input from these sensors, so then
Argue;I was just thinking about the other possibility, whether we should design it like this: in an intersection
Argue;If the user has to use the intersection symbol then we could definitely do it like this
Argue;if we have multiple intersections and then of course
Argue;if you assign like some kind of IDs or whatsoever to the traffic light then perhaps one traffic light could reference another traffic light and the theoretically. 
Argue;if you draw road here it should, you should be 
Argue;if you know it then you can take it into account
Argue;if you set, if you set the one with the arrow, if you set that one to being green 30 seconds then you know that that one the other one is up and down right
Argue;if you will start simulation
Argue;itís a simple solution but we could do it some way different like this but then we would probably need some kind of main, I donít know, main traffic light or reference point for the traffic lights so that we know, when will which one start and which one, so I mean
Argue;mean if we consider our example, I mean in some way, letís just 
Argue;No
Argue;No
Argue;No, I donít know, that doesnít matter.
Argue;o maybe I mean, thatís the thing, you just have to draw a road, because all of them should have traffic lights
Argue;Ok, yeah
Argue;or do we need this for every intersection?
Argue;or down to up
Argue;Or one
Argue;Or other shorts what you defined with the circle, letís just say for the safe of complicity, itís like this, so then this one would be green in the beginning and by no car would be in this area, no car would be here, thatís, here we have these two nice cars
Argue;or should you be able to set like, this is car spawn, the car spawn, which spawns cars and this is like a sync where cars disappear.
Argue;Perhaps this is not a very good idea to draw in this direction
Argue;perhaps we simplify draw intersections for lazy students
Argue;so basically 
Argue;So create a crash if this car would drive here
Argue;so either they should be able to use go like 20 seconds red, blablabla blablabla or depending on this senso
Argue;So I donít know
Argue;So I mean 
Argue;so if you can set how long the one that you draw an arrow to if she said this one to 20 seconds Green and maybe orange or yellow, 
Argue;so maybe 
Argue;so that is I mean the easiest I guess
Argue;so then you have an intersection 
Argue;so there is no undo
Argue;so we can see what we 
Argue;so we have 
Argue;thatís right, I agree, so we should 
Argue;the question is whether we, should they put the sensors wide away or whether we should do try to find a means brake without the sensors and see whether itís a, what we achieve there
Argue;use the road symbol and also draw intersections like this then of course we would need to allow him to draw traffic light symbols in addition to that
Argue;whether you should be able to position this car spawning symbol at the beginning or whether it should be just able to detect this is the beginning of the road
Argue;which would of course require us to be able to, I donít know, either
Argue;Yeah I mean it would be interesting because then you can create more complex pattern and so, or sequences or more than one traffic light.
Argue;Yeah so then we should be able to connect them somehow.
Argue;Yeah, exactly
Argue;Yeah, exactly, thatís what I mean,
Argue;Yeah, for me it doesnít matter
Argue;Yeah, I am not sure,
Argue;Yeah, of course we could also do it like this
Argue;Yeah, yeah
Argue;you have to switch to green or to orange or red
Assumption; I guess, every road that stops
Assumption; I mean it depends on how this should be implemented later, but the idea with this point, like spawning a car here, something like this, I donít know if we have here, I mean something like this and I think Iíd actually, yeah, Andreas is laughing about our painting skills
Assumption; mean I think it automatically that ok here you can spawn cars and 
Assumption; meant that if we want to detect it automatically we have to say 
Assumption;, I mean this would be a simple way, although 
Assumption;, I mean, you select one of them and thatís when you hit
Assumption;an entry point
Assumption;And then they have to use the road to connect them
Assumption;assume for beginning that if a car is on the street it just goes ahead and doesnít turn right or left or whatever.
Assumption;could basically finish the road and then the system, or the system has to detect: this is the start of the road and then there is something there then and in this way you can create new cars, cause 
Assumption;course would increase the complexity of the
Assumption;I mean must still identify it as an intersection so when, if it finds
Assumption;I think with this we will satisfy the task that a roads should be allowed for both to varying length and place and different arrangements 
Assumption;I was thinking about something like, I am very drift left, something like this then, I mean another possibility would be to, Iíll give it a try. 
Assumption;if you assign like some kind of IDs or whatsoever to the traffic light then perhaps one traffic light could reference another traffic light and the theoretically. 
Assumption;if you draw road here it should, you should be 
Assumption;if you set, if you set the one with the arrow, if you set that one to being green 30 seconds then you know that that one the other one is up and down right
Assumption;it is the starting time and we would put something like starting time, an absolute time, to say the first, to the right hand side on the bottom for instance the first starts at zero and then we have
Assumption;it was the idea that you can draw some single street
Assumption;mean one traffic light plus 5 seconds, so that they donít have an absolute arrangement 
Assumption;of course itís about to be important in which area there is no car as I mean itís probably just a certain range where we have sensors equipped and perhaps, I will just, this other area here, perhaps it is just a certain range so where we have this sensors and if itís no car in this area then we define there is no car to crossing right now
Assumption;should be some kind of traffic light 
Assumption;So I mean one way to to do with this if you click an intersection you get like a overview of that intersection somehow some representation and then you have like.
Assumption;so letís assume the user selects like a, the traffic lights, like this one
Assumption;So we have an implicit connection between traffic light in some wa
Assumption;that needs to detect this ending and handle this properly
Assumption;That the user could forget to draw a traffic light that is needed
Assumption;That you can slide or could zoom in, zoom out, something like this, so that here on the left hand side you go to change in the some way. 
Assumption;The question is if there is a car from here. I am fighting the software a bit. So this should be a car and we put here a car and here is a car
Assumption;the start of the simulation you have to pay a certain amount
Assumption;we need to assume some kind of absolute time then to do the arrangement in some, something like this, this would be, it would be possible to do it like this
Assumption;we start at zero and then we, and then the user can say
Assumption;when this one, when this sequence is over, should we have orange afterwards as well, 
Assumption;you trigger, so if you have the same here, so this is everything you need to set,
Awareness;Alright, I see it
Awareness;And then you should see,
Awareness;Can I draw so, do you see what I draw now?
Awareness;Can you hear me?
Awareness;did you make these dashed lines?
Awareness;Do I hear myself now?
Awareness;Do you see my arrow?
Awareness;I am not drawing exactly where I am pointing, so there might be some difficulties.
Awareness;I donít see anything.
Awareness;I donít think I, I donít see what you draw now.
Awareness;I mean this should be a street, or you can see what I was trying to do
Awareness;I try to outfigure so that we could see something again
Awareness;I was actually thinking about putting it to the left. 
Awareness;Mh
Awareness;No, no undoing
Awareness;No, we do not see anything.
Awareness;Ok, do you see me drawing?
Awareness;Ok, I see it
Awareness;Right now I just see the intersection with the two traffic lights and the two cars and the absolute timing.
Awareness;So right now we donít see no connection to you , I think
Awareness;So that means you canít see anything we have drawn before
Awareness;So this is what I am seeing in front of me
Awareness;So you can see what we have drawn before?
Awareness;So, we connect again.You donít see then you we no more draw.
Awareness;Something like that?
Awareness;Yeah
Awareness;Yeah, but I think I hear myself, anyways,
Awareness;Yeah, I can hear you
Awareness;Yes exactly,
Awareness;Yes, I see it, yes.
Awareness;Yes, of course, can you see the line?
Awareness;you see my arrow?
Behavioural Decision;because ok it takes from this signal turning green it takes 20 seconds before they arrive at this intersection so and then that one should be green when the first car arrives
Behavioural Decision;could calculate kind of how long the red the other one is going to be red so if you can set how long the one that you draw an arrow to if she said this one to 20 seconds Green and maybe orange or yellow, I donít know, five seconds or whatever then you know that this one is going to be if those are the only ones that you can set the green and yellow or orange then this one is automatically going to have red for 25 whatever but you can set so that you can't set but you can set this one to be 30 and 10 or
Behavioural Decision;five seconds red, five seconds is orange, twenty seconds green, not very likely, but thatís just for instance and then we could for instance say, then the traffic light to the top starts with orange after 35 seconds 
Behavioural Decision;I mean if it was green before, we have to change itís behavior.
Behavioural Decision;I mean we need some kind reference point for the time
Behavioural Decision;so we have to prevent that this car on this lane has green light and this lane at the same time
Behavioural Decision;Then you know that the one crossing must be red for 30 seconds and the same 30 seconds. And I donít know how orange behaves. Does this one, does that one turn orange when that one is that the other one is red, I mean
Behavioural Decision;we should have entering points and exiting points.
Clarification;do they have to?
Clarification;In the four?
Clarification;Is there a certain reason for you drawing this options of like roads or traffic signs to the right hand side of the window?
Clarification;Is this how they set, did you mean, by adding car symbols?
Clarification;What do you mean?
Clarification;Which other one
Clarification;Yeah, which one starts, yeah exactly, which one is triggered first, thatís what you mean?
Clarification;Yeah, you mean that we somehow connect them?
Clarification;you mean the signals of the same intersection
Clarification;You wouldnít provide some kind of element to draw intersections immediately but rather focus on drawing streets and then for like crossing streets we then have intersections that should be detected automatically?
Conciliate;No, I donít know, that doesnít matter.
Conciliate;Yeah, for me it doesnít matter
Coordinate Group Process;Ah no, this is not working
Coordinate Group Process;Ah, ok, so I donít know why, at least we can both draw
Coordinate Group Process;Ah, yes, ok, itís fine, so once again I will also try to draw something, ok?
Coordinate Group Process;And further we figure to, I mean we can delete it afterwards.
Coordinate Group Process;But ok, should we leave the main window as it is. I have it as a paper in my hand
Coordinate Group Process;first of should we both zoom out to the maximum so that we always see everything?
Coordinate Group Process;I donít think so
Coordinate Group Process;I think thatís everything to be said.
Coordinate Group Process;I think this should be the only issue right now
Coordinate Group Process;I thought I was drawing again, perhaps we need to activate the mouse again
Coordinate Group Process;mean first we can assign numbers here to be able to talk about it.
Coordinate Group Process;Ok
Coordinate Group Process;Ok
Coordinate Group Process;Ok
Coordinate Group Process;Ok, finger works
Coordinate Group Process;Ok, perhaps, I need to read this bullet point c again to actual look what it says
Coordinate Group Process;Ok, so where did we stop?
Coordinate Group Process;Outside, oh yeah
Coordinate Group Process;Perhaps, there are just some basic question in the beginning
Coordinate Group Process;So basically we could do first thing what was on the lefthand side, what I was trying to achieve here
Coordinate Group Process;So some streets again, delete that later
Coordinate Group Process;So thatís no, I think we didnít draw so much, so thatís no big deal
Coordinate Group Process;So what should we start with?
Coordinate Group Process;So what should we start with?
Coordinate Group Process;This is for demonstration purposes.
Coordinate Group Process;We can start right again.
Coordinate Group Process;We start all very again?
Coordinate Group Process;Well, the question is, if it is not working, you would need to do the drawing stuff.
Coordinate Group Process;What should we try to get it working or?
Coordinate Group Process;Yeah
Coordinate Group Process;Yeah do you want to summarise?
Coordinate Group Process;Yeah I see
Coordinate Group Process;Yeah, I mean, perhaps you can just add something, if I forget something
Coordinate Group Process;Yeah, no problem.
Coordinate Group Process;Yeah?
Coordinate Group Process;Yes
Disagree;And of course the, that I guess, that itís not something that we have to design
Disagree;But of course would increase the complexity of the
Disagree;I donít think so,
Disagree;I think so because you should be able to have, you should be able to have intersections with no sensors then the intersections lights should be able to change based on the input from these sensors, so then
Disagree;No
Disagree;No
Doubt;, I am not sure
Doubt;Ah, ok because that was something I was just wondering about, whether we should
Doubt;am still not sure how to
Doubt;But how should that work
Doubt;but I am not sure, where
Doubt;but I donít know how to easily program that kind of behavior
Doubt;but I don't know that's also
Doubt;can both of them be orange at the same time for example?
Doubt;I am not sure
Doubt;I am not sure
Doubt;I am not sure how to deal with the wave her.
Doubt;I donít know
Doubt;I donít know
Doubt;I donít know how to design it
Doubt;I donít know,
Doubt;I donít know, 
Doubt;I donít know.
Doubt;Perhaps this is not a very good idea to draw in this direction
Doubt;So I donít know
Doubt;the question is whether we, should they put the sensors wide away or whether we should do try to find a means brake without the sensors and see whether itís a, what we achieve there
Doubt;which would of course require us to be able to, I donít know, either
Doubt;Yeah, I am not sure,
Elaborate; also we have it on the laptop screen
Elaborate;Also before we draw again so first I can right now try to save the image
Explain and Clarify;from other intersections
Explain and Clarify;It depends on how we want the users to interact with,
Explain and Clarify;ok you mean to achieve the green
Explain and Clarify;Ok, so we do not have like a circle or like a closed system of streets but
Explain and Clarify;So that one crossing does that one turn orange when they one going down to up when that one one turns red
Explain and Clarify;So you have a long road and each intersection will be green when the car arrives
Explain and Clarify;thatís, this was just how it is depicted by the, this was just a proposal for how it is depicted by the system
Explain and Clarify;With the green wave.
Functionality; if the user can press on a traffic light and then letís say 
Functionality;,
Functionality;1 and 3 are our active traffic lights at the moment and we realise that at 2 and 4 a car has reached the sensor in that area, then we could make both of them say ok, right now you need to wait, or basically you need to wait but 1 and 3 donít have a car in the waiting area so we put you on green and the other one to red, so wouldnít it just be basically like this so, we consider the other two which are relevant for the traffic light and both have no car and we have a car entering our ??? area or our sensor area then we simply switch the traffic lights
Functionality;a car spawner
Functionality;But that, yeah, I mean, thatís the thing, they will always work in pairs, it doesnít matter if it is 3 or 1, that have a car, just that itís, I mean north and south, or up and down
Functionality;I donít know, 10 cars per minute, or whatever way you want to define it then itís actually in this, in this certain interval it just produces new cars and shows new cars crossing the traffic lights, something like this
Functionality;I guess a common, atleast here in Sweden is that the main road is always green if it doesnít detect anything coming from the crossing roads so the big road is always green but when thereís cars coming in from left or right it detects that and then it sets the main road to red so that they can join
Functionality;I mean depending on how it works, yeah, exactly, so do we have to prevent them to be both, they shouldnít be green at the same time, thatís an obvious one, but could they be orange at the same time but in different phases, one before it turns red and one before it turns green
Functionality;I mean it could default to spawning no cars and then you can set it to a frequence or something
Functionality;I mean should we only be able to spawn cars
Functionality;I mean two roads overlapping and it creates an intersection there, it could add a the traffic lights
Functionality;I think so because you should be able to have, you should be able to have intersections with no sensors then the intersections lights should be able to change based on the input from these sensors, so then
Functionality;If the user has to use the intersection symbol then we could definitely do it like this
Functionality;mean what you could do is just control how long each of them are green and then the other one is gone be red automatically so then you can say ok this one is going to be green for, I donít know, whatís normal, but 20 seconds and this one is going to be green for 30 seconds and then they just go back and forth
Functionality;Now I think they should be able to set it. They should be able to describe the behaviour and you should we should allow for a variety of sequence and timing of schemas or schemes so I guess somehow we have to they should go automatically but you should be able to set the timing.
Functionality;push here green 
Functionality;so that we donít say, ok it turns red then immediately the next second the other one turns green
Functionality;So that we need to create everything and just let it execute or whether we do some kind of simulation and easily can interact with it and can change behavior or it.
Functionality;So yo click on it and then you set that are 10 cars here every 60 seconds or something and then you hit play and let it
Functionality;So you mean if the user uses the intersection symbol, then it would automatically create the traffic light in a specific way.
Functionality;that user can actually start the simulatio
Functionality;Thatís for sure, the user can decide whether itís an intersection with sensors or without sensors, by the imaged one with a sensor would it be sufficient to have this type of logic part simplified version
Functionality;the user has to define it up front and just let it simulate without any changes or whether he should be able to start the simulation and then, if he decides to, notices there are not enough cars, wants to have 200 more, so that he can spawn new cars, while the simulation is being done
Functionality;Then our system would need to detect this and put, I guess, switch this to, I donít know, orange or, I think itís a problem that you could draw, this problems my draw, something was wrong before, so we would probably need to change this to red light and then this to orange or green and this switching right.
Functionality;we probably also need some additional delays to make sure that not some,
Functionality;which spawns cars and this is like a sync where cars disappear
Functionality;Yes, a minimap
Functionality;you can create new cars or define the number of cars
Functionality;you should be able to say how many cars per or something it should create
Functionality;You wouldnít provide some kind of element to draw intersections immediately but rather focus on drawing streets and then for like crossing streets we then have intersections that should be detected automatically?
Infer;Because otherwise the other cars just need to wait until no more cars actually crossing the traffic light and we need to take this into account.
Infer;Because otherwise this might result in a crash
Infer;because then this might result in an accident
Infer;if we have multiple intersections and then of course
Infer;o maybe I mean, thatís the thing, you just have to draw a road, because all of them should have traffic lights
Infer;so basically 
Infer;So I mean 
Infer;so maybe 
Infer;so that is I mean the easiest I guess
Infer;so then you have an intersection 
Infer;so there is no undo
Infer;so we can see what we 
Infer;so we have 
Infer;use the road symbol and also draw intersections like this then of course we would need to allow him to draw traffic light symbols in addition to that
Inform; also we have it on the laptop screen
Inform; am trying to remember how thatís in real traffic
Inform; because basically I mean, you could basically finish the 
Inform; because with the difficulties in the offset itís a bit problematic to draw this
Inform;Also before we draw again so first I can right now try to save the image
Inform;Another question is: Which way the user can put a car onto the lane, as then there might be different starting points where cars can
Inform;at the start of the road you can create new cars or define the number of cars, whether they want to, changing it during the simulation
Inform;because for some reason I thought that by clicking the select button and selecting a part I would be able to move this selected part to some other place in the
Inform;because I am not sure whether 
Inform;because I have basically forgot what was written 
Inform;because then it would be interesting to have like roads with the turning lanes and stuff and see how that affects the flow
Inform;because then you can have a green wave for example
Inform;because there is quite a lot of information we have to present somehow
Inform;because we need a reference point.
Inform;but I think we need for, do we need this for one intersection
Inform;But that, yeah, I mean, thatís the thing, they will always work in pairs, it doesnít matter if it is 3 or 1, that have a car, just that itís, I mean north and south, or up and down
Inform;erhaps we have somewhat, five seconds orange, 30 seconds green
Inform;from other intersections
Inform;I am thinking maybe we should have that in,
Inform;I donít know, 10 cars per minute, or whatever way you want to define it then itís actually in this, in this certain interval it just produces new cars and shows new cars crossing the traffic lights, something like this
Inform;I guess a common, atleast here in Sweden is that the main road is always green if it doesnít detect anything coming from the crossing roads so the big road is always green but when thereís cars coming in from left or right it detects that and then it sets the main road to red so that they can join
Inform;I guess we should have a play button for the simulation and when you hit that one, it starts with the one that is marked
Inform;I mean if  you should be able to create like green waves and stuff.
Inform;I mean it would be more fun to have turning
Inform;I mean must still identify it as an intersection 
Inform;I mean so every start of a road that has just starting is, I guess an entry point then and then you can set it on these, so here
Inform;I think I read it somewhere, letís just assume that it was written somewhere
Inform;I think I would actually, like something like this that you can put some points on this and I donít know, a car spawner or whatever and say click on it and the you say another one, another one, another one so that the user can basically decide, where to put it and create as many cars as he likes to
Inform;I think perhaps we can 
Inform;I think the more interesting and the more challenging part is behavior of the traffic lights
Inform;I would like this to be an intersection automatically
Inform;It depends on how we want the users to interact with,
Inform;Letís see, combinations of individual signals should not be
Inform;maybe itís enough to set those
Inform;maybe we have a delay where nothing happens and then it just goes through the flow here and when that one is done it jumps to the up and down again, because as you said, up and down and left and right will be the same, right?
Inform;mean depending on how it works, yeah, exactly, so do we have to prevent them to be both, they shouldnít be green at the same time, thatís an obvious one, but could they be orange at the same time but in different phases, one before it turns red and one before it turns green.
Inform;mean the traffic lights look good now, I think
Inform;mean what you could do is just control how long each of them are green and then the other one is gone be red automatically so then you can say ok this one is going to be green for, I donít know, whatís normal, but 20 seconds and this one is going to be green for 30 seconds and then they just go back and forth
Inform;mean, this one turning red, that one that we were talking about, could trigger the flow in this one
Inform;o maybe it should be, only enters at end of roads somewhere
Inform;Ok itís a bad idea to arrange it according to the direction of the lane
Inform;ok you mean to achieve the green
Inform;Ok, so we do not have like a circle or like a closed system of streets but
Inform;Or should we just say here, here you just spawn cars, oh no, another way, here and here and here  and here
Inform;Perhaps we could draw some simple examples of what it could look like.
Inform;So I am thinking, how to represent the sequence because if you have it like that you can have like a box here or somewhere else which says, ok, this sequence is triggered by signal two becoming green.
Inform;So I think perhaps we can just focus on the traffic light and the description of the behavior before we draw anything again
Inform;So I think, whatís possible, correct me if you disagree, it might be possible that there is no car on lane 1 and there are cars on lane 3, so just because no cars one lane 1 does mean that you can turn traffic light 2 to green, because if a car is at 3 then there might be an accident by this.
Inform;So in this case it is like in 1 has no, 1 no car and three no car, so you can turn 2 and 4, I donít know, something like this.
Inform;So once again before we can probably, or how is it done? We need to consider those, both traffic lights again so, so this one and this one, another simplified version
Inform;So that one crossing does that one turn orange when they one going down to up when that one one turns red
Inform;So the question is how they should interact with the traffic lights, I guess.
Inform;So the question, we gonna have to think about when traffic light are turning orange
Inform;so then I mean if you set the one going up and down, down and up, to be green for 30 seconds, orange for 10 then you know that the other one gonna be red for at least 40 if I remember the numbers I used.
Inform;So this should be easy the main question here is I guess
Inform;So we do not need to, the user doesnít need to draw a new kind of symbol as similar to the net but itís
Inform;So we need to find a way to, for the user to describe the behavior
Inform;So yo click on it and then you set that
Inform;So you have a long road and each intersection will be green when the car arrives
Inform;So, yeah, some way of indicating where it will start
Inform;T they could just cross the traffic lights and also next to them
Inform;That you define it in the user interface if you if you describe the behavior, perhaps like, I donít know. I mean it may just probably not, perhaps not a main for reference
Inform;thatís, this was just how it is depicted by the, this was just a proposal for how it is depicted by the system
Inform;The last sentence of the fourth point
Inform;The question is whether
Inform;the question is whether we could give this to our advantage
Inform;then letís say that maybe there is a delay before the other starts it sequence being orange and then
Inform;Then our system would need to detect this and put, I guess, switch this to, I donít know, orange or, I think itís a problem that you could draw, this problems my draw, something was wrong before, so we would probably need to change this to red light and then this to orange or green and this switching right.
Inform;then you can say that ok this sequence is triggered by this signal turning green for example so when this other turns green then the sequence will go and then you can have
Inform;we could actually draw some kind of car symbol there
Inform;We just have to, like one traffic light at the beginning, something like this. So then we know for sure that the first car can drive up here, so some other car can also for 35 seconds at least.
Inform;we need to assume some kind of absolute time
Inform;we need to make sure that the traffic light to the right
Inform;we need to make sure that this cannot happen.
Inform;We say 45 and then I donít know, maybe we set orange afterwards as well, so this is that one that this, that one we talked about first, the one going down and up, when that one is red, this flow triggers, so it just goes back and forth and then maybe as you said
Inform;With the green wave.
Inform;Yeah, main or start or whatever
Inform;Yeah, so maybe we should draw it a little bit bigger, I mean because there is quite a lot of information we have to present somehow.
Inform;Yeah, so this should be always be shown on the bottom in this way here.
Inform;Yes, a minimap
Inform;you should be able to say how many cars per or something it should create
Information;do we have to do something
Justify; because basically I mean, you could basically finish the 
Justify; because with the difficulties in the offset itís a bit problematic to draw this
Justify;because for some reason I thought that by clicking the select button and selecting a part I would be able to move this selected part to some other place in the
Justify;because I am not sure whether 
Justify;because I have basically forgot what was written 
Justify;because then it would be interesting to have like roads with the turning lanes and stuff and see how that affects the flow
Justify;because then you can have a green wave for example
Justify;because there is quite a lot of information we have to present somehow
Justify;because we need a reference point.
Justify;so then I mean if you set the one going up and down, down and up, to be green for 30 seconds, orange for 10 then you know that the other one gonna be red for at least 40 if I remember the numbers I used.
Justify;The last sentence of the fourth point
Lead;Another question is: Which way the user can put a car onto the lane, as then there might be different starting points where cars can
Lead;I mean if  you should be able to create like green waves and stuff.
Lead;I mean must still identify it as an intersection 
Lead;I think I read it somewhere, letís just assume that it was written somewhere

Lead;Yeah, so this should be always be shown on the bottom in this way here.
Maintenance;alright?
Maintenance;Because orange is both, preparing to start, well how does it work, and then it is also hinting that soon it will be red, right?
Maintenance;But do you mean like this?
Maintenance;But they will always be the same, right?
Maintenance;Can you remember, did the task description say something concerning this
Maintenance;did you hear Rodi?
Maintenance;Did you turn of the screen recording?
Maintenance;do you get what I mean?
Maintenance;I am sorry for this ugly appearance
Maintenance;I was thinking if we should have triggers as you said I mean of the signals.
Maintenance;is it right?
Maintenance;No, no go ahead.
Maintenance;ok?
Maintenance;Or what do you think?
Maintenance;perhaps you can do the intersections
Maintenance;right
Maintenance;right?
Maintenance;right?
Maintenance;Shall I give it a try?
Maintenance;should be able to set that one?
Maintenance;so I am sorry for that
Maintenance;so we keep that?
Maintenance;So you mean if the user uses the intersection symbol, then it would automatically create the traffic light in a specific way.
Maintenance;sorry
Maintenance;sorry
Maintenance;ulation, I mean, letís just assume that, to safe some complicity that we will start with, that we only have this simple intersection and we start the simulation and this car makes this and there is no car, it would actually start with a green fix at this traffic light, right?
Maintenance;With the sensors or?
Maintenance;With this slidebar at the bottom, or so something like this
Maintenance;You know what I mean?
Maintenance;you mean that user doesnít have to draw it anyway, but that the software would detect it and then say ok, you draw an intersection, I will add traffic lights on my own
Mediate;But then I can also the delete the selected part and not everything.
Mediate;Do you know this, Rodi, do you know that, currently certain parts are selected in purple. Is this the selected part for the smartboard?
Mediate;Ok
Mediate;Perhaps, Rodi, you can answer this question: I would like to select this part on the right hand side, the streets and so and move this to the left hand side. Is this possible here?
Mediate;Rodi, Andreas just asked me, or just said to me that I should ask you how long we still have for this, cause I think officially it is more or less over in, I donít know five minutes
Mediate;Thank you very much
Mediate;Yeah, thank you
Mediate;Yeah, thank you
Motivate;Exactly
Motivate;I mean, I am not sure whether it is perhaps done differently in different countries, but I think at least what I am used to is that it would be on the lefthand side
Motivate;I think thatís the most interesting way, to see the individual cars
Motivate;it was written in the requirements, I think, I read it somewhere
Motivate;Ok, to visualise it, how busy it is
Motivate;so for instance and the traffic light on the, for the, for this car, that specifies something like 20 seconds green and I donít know, other delays for orange and red and accordingly for the other ones
Motivate;that would be the most fun I think,
Motivate;would be basically that we donít say, after 30 or 50 and then you have to take in account, ok, then does this one go to green and then does this one go to green and then does this one go to green,
Motivate;Yeah, thatís a good point
Offer Alternative;and so, or sequences or more than one traffic 
Offer Alternative;But
Offer Alternative;But does the user need to be able to define in our simplified version?
Offer Alternative;but thatís what I meant with my circles
Offer Alternative;I didnít take it into account that it says that enters the map on a given road, so but then itís probably better to do like this at the start of the road or at the end of the road,
Offer Alternative;I mean the easiest way is to just have as you said, timings
Offer Alternative;I was just thinking about the other possibility, whether we should design it like this: in an intersection
Offer Alternative;itís a simple solution but we could do it some way different like this but then we would probably need some kind of main, I donít know, main traffic light or reference point for the traffic lights so that we know, when will which one start and which one, so I mean
Offer Alternative;or do we need this for every intersection?
Offer Alternative;or down to up
Offer Alternative;Or one
Offer Alternative;Or other shorts what you defined with the circle, letís just say for the safe of complicity, itís like this, so then this one would be green in the beginning and by no car would be in this area, no car would be here, thatís, here we have these two nice cars
Offer Alternative;or should you be able to set like, this is car spawn, the car spawn, which spawns cars and this is like a sync where cars disappear.
Offer Alternative;perhaps we simplify draw intersections for lazy students
Offer Alternative;so either they should be able to use go like 20 seconds red, blablabla blablabla or depending on this senso
Offer Alternative;whether you should be able to position this car spawning symbol at the beginning or whether it should be just able to detect this is the beginning of the road
Offer Alternative;Yeah, of course we could also do it like this
Offer Alternative;you have to switch to green or to orange or red
Opinion;but the question is where we put something to zoom in and out. Perhaps in the same way it is done in the whiteboard softwa
Opinion;Do we assume that the cars always drive straight ahead or maybe, because otherwise we would need to differentiate between roads that turn to the right, roads that turn to the left, just ahead
Opinion;ow to control the flow.
Opinion;So, ok, what kind of options should we have?
Opinion;What would be the best procedure to start with.
Propose Exception; but of course also 
Propose Exception;anyway, but that the 
Propose Exception;but I donít think it is necessary, but I mean that depends 
Propose Exception;but I mean a very easy way, oh but then you have to rename them
Propose Exception;but I think it might not be very handsome for meaning for the
Propose Exception;but if 
Propose Exception;but rather focus 
Propose Exception;but that they reference each other in some way.
Propose Exception;but then 
Propose Exception;but then I mean 
Propose Exception;But then I was thinking about how to describe the sequence and 
Propose Exception;but we probably also need to take some delay into account
Propose Exception;I donít know 
Reinforce;Exactly
Reinforce;I mean, I am not sure whether it is perhaps done differently in different countries, but I think at least what I am used to is that it would be on the lefthand side
Reinforce;I think thatís the most interesting way, to see the individual cars
Reinforce;it was written in the requirements, I think, I read it somewhere
Reinforce;Ok, to visualise it, how busy it is
Reinforce;so for instance and the traffic light on the, for the, for this car, that specifies something like 20 seconds green and I donít know, other delays for orange and red and accordingly for the other ones
Reinforce;that would be the most fun I think,
Reinforce;would be basically that we donít say, after 30 or 50 and then you have to take in account, ok, then does this one go to green and then does this one go to green and then does this one go to green,
Reinforce;Yeah, thatís a good point
Reject;No
Reject;No
Request;but the question is where we put something to zoom in and out. Perhaps in the same way it is done in the whiteboard softwa
Request;do they have to?
Request;Do we assume that the cars always drive straight ahead or maybe, because otherwise we would need to differentiate between roads that turn to the right, roads that turn to the left, just ahead
Request;do we have to do something
Request;In the four?
Request;Is there a certain reason for you drawing this options of like roads or traffic signs to the right hand side of the window?
Request;Is this how they set, did you mean, by adding car symbols?
Request;ow to control the flow.
Request;So, ok, what kind of options should we have?
Request;What do you mean?
Request;What would be the best procedure to start with.
Request;Which other one
Request;Yeah, which one starts, yeah exactly, which one is triggered first, thatís what you mean?
Request;Yeah, you mean that we somehow connect them?
Request;you mean the signals of the same intersection
Request;You wouldnít provide some kind of element to draw intersections immediately but rather focus on drawing streets and then for like crossing streets we then have intersections that should be detected automatically?
Request Confirmation;alright?
Request Confirmation;Because orange is both, preparing to start, well how does it work, and then it is also hinting that soon it will be red, right?
Request Confirmation;But do you mean like this?
Request Confirmation;But they will always be the same, right?
Request Confirmation;Can you remember, did the task description say something concerning this
Request Confirmation;did you hear Rodi?
Request Confirmation;Did you turn of the screen recording?
Request Confirmation;do you get what I mean?
Request Confirmation;I was thinking if we should have triggers as you said I mean of the signals.
Request Confirmation;is it right?
Request Confirmation;ok?
Request Confirmation;Or what do you think?
Request Confirmation;right
Request Confirmation;right?
Request Confirmation;right?
Request Confirmation;Shall I give it a try?
Request Confirmation;should be able to set that one?
Request Confirmation;so we keep that?
Request Confirmation;So you mean if the user uses the intersection symbol, then it would automatically create the traffic light in a specific way.
Request Confirmation;ulation, I mean, letís just assume that, to safe some complicity that we will start with, that we only have this simple intersection and we start the simulation and this car makes this and there is no car, it would actually start with a green fix at this traffic light, right?
Request Confirmation;With the sensors or?
Request Confirmation;With this slidebar at the bottom, or so something like this
Request Confirmation;You know what I mean?
Request Confirmation;you mean that user doesnít have to draw it anyway, but that the software would detect it and then say ok, you draw an intersection, I will add traffic lights on my own
Request Focus Change;having sensors in the street.
Request Focus Change;just let me draw something again
Request Focus Change;ok what we are missing right now is the sensor, is there anything else what we are missing right now, despite the sensors?
Request Focus Change;So I think perhaps we can just focus on the traffic light
Request Focus Change;ut this is just an infinite ratio detail that we donít need to discuss, so I think, whatís important here
Request Focus Change;Yes, ok, ok, I think what we just talked about before this third point you said that you
Scoping;But does the user need to be able to define in our simplified version?
Scoping;by the imaged one with a sensor would it be sufficient to have this type of logic part simplified version
Scoping;So I mean what shouldnít be supported by the system
Suggest; am trying to remember how thatís in real traffic
Suggest;at the start of the road you can create new cars or define the number of cars, whether they want to, changing it during the simulation
Suggest;but I think we need for, do we need this for one intersection
Suggest;But that, yeah, I mean, thatís the thing, they will always work in pairs, it doesnít matter if it is 3 or 1, that have a car, just that itís, I mean north and south, or up and down
Suggest;erhaps we have somewhat, five seconds orange, 30 seconds green
Suggest;I am thinking maybe we should have that in,
Suggest;I donít know, 10 cars per minute, or whatever way you want to define it then itís actually in this, in this certain interval it just produces new cars and shows new cars crossing the traffic lights, something like this
Suggest;I guess a common, atleast here in Sweden is that the main road is always green if it doesnít detect anything coming from the crossing roads so the big road is always green but when thereís cars coming in from left or right it detects that and then it sets the main road to red so that they can join
Suggest;I guess we should have a play button for the simulation and when you hit that one, it starts with the one that is marked
Suggest;I mean it would be more fun to have turning
Suggest;I mean so every start of a road that has just starting is, I guess an entry point then and then you can set it on these, so here
Suggest;I think I would actually, like something like this that you can put some points on this and I donít know, a car spawner or whatever and say click on it and the you say another one, another one, another one so that the user can basically decide, where to put it and create as many cars as he likes to
Suggest;I think perhaps we can 
Suggest;I think the more interesting and the more challenging part is behavior of the traffic lights
Suggest;I would like this to be an intersection automatically
Suggest;maybe itís enough to set those
Suggest;maybe we have a delay where nothing happens and then it just goes through the flow here and when that one is done it jumps to the up and down again, because as you said, up and down and left and right will be the same, right?
Suggest;mean depending on how it works, yeah, exactly, so do we have to prevent them to be both, they shouldnít be green at the same time, thatís an obvious one, but could they be orange at the same time but in different phases, one before it turns red and one before it turns green.
Suggest;mean the traffic lights look good now, I think
Suggest;mean, this one turning red, that one that we were talking about, could trigger the flow in this one
Suggest;o maybe it should be, only enters at end of roads somewhere
Suggest;Ok itís a bad idea to arrange it according to the direction of the lane
Suggest;Or should we just say here, here you just spawn cars, oh no, another way, here and here and here  and here
Suggest;So I am thinking, how to represent the sequence because if you have it like that you can have like a box here or somewhere else which says, ok, this sequence is triggered by signal two becoming green.
Suggest;So I think perhaps we can just focus on the traffic light and the description of the behavior before we draw anything again
Suggest;So I think, whatís possible, correct me if you disagree, it might be possible that there is no car on lane 1 and there are cars on lane 3, so just because no cars one lane 1 does mean that you can turn traffic light 2 to green, because if a car is at 3 then there might be an accident by this.
Suggest;So in this case it is like in 1 has no, 1 no car and three no car, so you can turn 2 and 4, I donít know, something like this.
Suggest;So once again before we can probably, or how is it done? We need to consider those, both traffic lights again so, so this one and this one, another simplified version
Suggest;So we do not need to, the user doesnít need to draw a new kind of symbol as similar to the net but itís
Suggest;So yo click on it and then you set that
Suggest;So, yeah, some way of indicating where it will start
Suggest;T they could just cross the traffic lights and also next to them
Suggest;That you define it in the user interface if you if you describe the behavior, perhaps like, I donít know. I mean it may just probably not, perhaps not a main for reference
Suggest;then letís say that maybe there is a delay before the other starts it sequence being orange and then
Suggest;Then our system would need to detect this and put, I guess, switch this to, I donít know, orange or, I think itís a problem that you could draw, this problems my draw, something was wrong before, so we would probably need to change this to red light and then this to orange or green and this switching right.
Suggest;then you can say that ok this sequence is triggered by this signal turning green for example so when this other turns green then the sequence will go and then you can have
Suggest;we could actually draw some kind of car symbol there
Suggest;We just have to, like one traffic light at the beginning, something like this. So then we know for sure that the first car can drive up here, so some other car can also for 35 seconds at least.
Suggest;We say 45 and then I donít know, maybe we set orange afterwards as well, so this is that one that this, that one we talked about first, the one going down and up, when that one is red, this flow triggers, so it just goes back and forth and then maybe as you said
Suggest;Yeah, main or start or whatever
Suggest;Yes, a minimap
Suggest;you should be able to say how many cars per or something it should create
Suggest Action;No, no go ahead.
Suggest Action;perhaps you can do the intersections
Summarize Information;because basically are two directions here: up and down or left and right
Summarize Information;but then we have 2a so they shouldn't be able to set combinations that would result in a crash so that's
Summarize Information;I think it is written in one of the part two: Combinations of individual signals that would result in crashes should not be allowed.
Summarize Information;I think it says somewhere that all the intersection must have traffic lights and all of them are 4 way so I guess the traffic light arrangement would be the same they will all have.
Summarize Information;It says students should be able to change the traffic density that enters the map on a given road
Summarize Information;It says that the light behavior should able to change based on the input from the sensors
Summarize Information;must be able to design each intersection with or without the option of sensors that detect whether any car are present on a given lane
Summarize Information;now again it says all interaction, intersections should be four way,
Summarize Information;Ok, so the requirements, the first bullet point I think would be done with this
Summarize Information;So I think with this we will satisfy the task that a roads should be allowed for both to varying length and place and different arrangements of intersections should be created and it is not restricted to a certain amount of intersections, so this should be fine, I think so
Summarize Information;We basically provide the user possibility to draw roads and to simplify drawing intersections we would have different kind of symbols so that the user doesnít have to draw nice roads in arrangement properly but there we have an intersection symbol and perhaps we can also provide and additional intersection symbol to be able to differentiate between sensor equipped intersections and none sensor equipped intersections and for the definition of the behavior we have a simplified model which says, ok basically we have two directions like from left to right and right to left, and up and down and down and up, so these are basically behaving in the same way and then the user can define the timing, how long it should be red or orange and green or from red to orange and from green to orange and then there must be some kind of main traffic light so that we know  that we start with this one and the other two traffic lights which are affected by this behave accordingly. So for example after 40 seconds or 42 seconds the cars can drive from right to left or left to right and then again after 100 seconds or whatever it switches again and the beginning of a street the user can click in a certain area and if he clicks there he can define a number of cars he wants to spawn in a certain time at a road and the cars would actually be shown with comparatively nice images of cars, comparable to the ones we created like art and yeah I think if an intersection is sensor equipped, that also takes a simplified model into account, like in this case, if it seems, there is no car in 1 and 3 but cars are waiting or entering the sensor zone in 2 or 4 then it could switch the behavior and put the ones on green and the other ones on red so that we avoid having a long period of waiting cars now there are more cars driving, and I am not sure whether I forgot something but, yeah of course we have a play button to start the simulation and the user can zoom in and zoom out and focus on a certain area of the map equivalent to the smartboard software and yeah, I am not sure whether I forgot something.
Suppose; if it was green before, we have to change 
Suppose; if we select 
Suppose; if we, first time when you draw something and then try to play 
Suppose; meant that if we want to detect it automatically we have to say 
Suppose;If the user has to use the intersection symbol then we could definitely do it like this
Suppose;if you assign like some kind of IDs or whatsoever to the traffic light then perhaps one traffic light could reference another traffic light and the theoretically. 
Suppose;if you draw road here it should, you should be 
Suppose;if you know it then you can take it into account
Suppose;if you set, if you set the one with the arrow, if you set that one to being green 30 seconds then you know that that one the other one is up and down right
Suppose;if you will start simulation
Suppose;mean if we consider our example, I mean in some way, letís just 
Suppose;So create a crash if this car would drive here
Suppose;so if you can set how long the one that you draw an arrow to if she said this one to 20 seconds Green and maybe orange or yellow, 
Task;Ah no, this is not working
Task;Ah, ok, so I donít know why, at least we can both draw
Task;Ah, yes, ok, itís fine, so once again I will also try to draw something, ok?
Task;And further we figure to, I mean we can delete it afterwards.
Task;because basically are two directions here: up and down or left and right
Task;But ok, should we leave the main window as it is. I have it as a paper in my hand
Task;but then we have 2a so they shouldn't be able to set combinations that would result in a crash so that's
Task;first of should we both zoom out to the maximum so that we always see everything?
Task;having sensors in the street.
Task;I donít think so
Task;I think it is written in one of the part two: Combinations of individual signals that would result in crashes should not be allowed.
Task;I think it says somewhere that all the intersection must have traffic lights and all of them are 4 way so I guess the traffic light arrangement would be the same they will all have.
Task;I think thatís everything to be said.
Task;I think this should be the only issue right now
Task;I thought I was drawing again, perhaps we need to activate the mouse again
Task;It says students should be able to change the traffic density that enters the map on a given road
Task;It says that the light behavior should able to change based on the input from the sensors
Task;just let me draw something again
Task;mean first we can assign numbers here to be able to talk about it.
Task;must be able to design each intersection with or without the option of sensors that detect whether any car are present on a given lane
Task;now again it says all interaction, intersections should be four way,
Task;Ok
Task;Ok
Task;Ok
Task;ok what we are missing right now is the sensor, is there anything else what we are missing right now, despite the sensors?
Task;Ok, finger works
Task;Ok, perhaps, I need to read this bullet point c again to actual look what it says
Task;Ok, so the requirements, the first bullet point I think would be done with this
Task;Ok, so where did we stop?
Task;Outside, oh yeah
Task;Perhaps, there are just some basic question in the beginning
Task;So basically we could do first thing what was on the lefthand side, what I was trying to achieve here
Task;So I think perhaps we can just focus on the traffic light
Task;So I think with this we will satisfy the task that a roads should be allowed for both to varying length and place and different arrangements of intersections should be created and it is not restricted to a certain amount of intersections, so this should be fine, I think so
Task;So some streets again, delete that later
Task;So thatís no, I think we didnít draw so much, so thatís no big deal
Task;So what should we start with?
Task;So what should we start with?
Task;This is for demonstration purposes.
Task;ut this is just an infinite ratio detail that we donít need to discuss, so I think, whatís important here
Task;We basically provide the user possibility to draw roads and to simplify drawing intersections we would have different kind of symbols so that the user doesnít have to draw nice roads in arrangement properly but there we have an intersection symbol and perhaps we can also provide and additional intersection symbol to be able to differentiate between sensor equipped intersections and none sensor equipped intersections and for the definition of the behavior we have a simplified model which says, ok basically we have two directions like from left to right and right to left, and up and down and down and up, so these are basically behaving in the same way and then the user can define the timing, how long it should be red or orange and green or from red to orange and from green to orange and then there must be some kind of main traffic light so that we know  that we start with this one and the other two traffic lights which are affected by this behave accordingly.

Task;We can start right again.
Task;We start all very again?
Task;Well, the question is, if it is not working, you would need to do the drawing stuff.
Task;What should we try to get it working or?
Task;Yeah
Task;Yeah do you want to summarise?
Task;Yeah I see
Task;Yeah, I mean, perhaps you can just add something, if I forget something
Task;Yeah, no problem.
Task;Yeah?
Task;Yes
Task;Yes, ok, ok, I think what we just talked about before this third point you said that you
Technical Decision;Ah, so Rodi recommended me to, when you draw or, use the middle zoom
Technical Problem;Ah, no, now I deleted everything
Technical Problem;Ah, right now I can draw with my finger
Technical Problem;for some reason I do not see what I am drawing right now, I canít see myself so, but I can see yourís, so
Technical Problem;For some reason the skype connection is getting worse and 
Technical Problem;I canít draw with the
Technical Problem;I mean this should be deactivated, right? We can try it out to see whether. I will give it another try
Technical Problem;Thatís really difficult with the offset.
Technical Problem;The offset is a bit problematic here, I am not pointing exactly,
Technical Problem;Wait a second perhaps, sorry to interrupt you but Andreas just told me that apparently you are no longer connected, we see clients zero.
Technical Problem;Yeah, apparently it got, we have still further problems with the software so we selected a certain part and deleted it but apparently it deleted everything.
Technical Problem;Yeah, itís a, me neither, so mouse activated or what? So, yeah currently I cannot draw anything right now, but I donít know why.
Technical Problem;You arenít connected anymore, Rodi
Technical Question;But I donít see anything or do I only see stuff that is drawn after I reconnected?
Technical Question;Is it possible to save it and then to load it back? Or do we have to draw again?
Technical Question;So if we select something and delete it we always need to look at what is shown in purple.
Usability and User Interface;because I mean you could use the same symbol and the user just selects the, I donít know with sensors, or we could have a different symbol with sensor equipped, something like this
Usability and User Interface;click an intersection
Usability and User Interface;click on it and then you set that are 10 cars here every 60 seconds
Usability and User Interface;hat you define it in the user interface if you if you describe the behavior, perhaps like, I donít know. I mean it may just probably not, perhaps not a main for reference
Usability and User Interface;how exactly this is declared by the user and depicted by the system is up to you, so we depict and how we will declare, itís, or how the user could declare and then I guess for the way we would depict it and perhaps we could try, I mean what would you think of just drawing some very simple car in there and depicting this traffic in this way so that he actually sees car symbols, something like this. I guess this is what this refers to this aspect in the requirement description
Usability and User Interface;I guess we should have a play button for the simulation and when you hit that one, it starts with the one that is marked
Usability and User Interface;I mean like a simple window
Usability and User Interface;if they have to use the intersection button and then they can connect intersections or.
Usability and User Interface;if you click on an intersection you get to another window, or view
Usability and User Interface;in which way we allow the user for actually describing it but perhaps we can just say to enter they could somehow select this traffic light.
Usability and User Interface;In which way we can present this to the user,
Usability and User Interface;Is there a certain reason for you drawing this options of like roads or traffic signs to the right hand side of the window
Usability and User Interface;it might be very easy for a user to define it like this
Usability and User Interface;It should be an arrow, I wanted to play with
Usability and User Interface;maybe her we have the stuff you can draw, so you can draw roads, so this are buttons and you can
Usability and User Interface;o maybe I mean, thatís the thing, you just have to draw a road, because all of them should have traffic lights
Usability and User Interface;perhaps we simplify draw intersections for lazy students
Usability and User Interface;perhaps you can also just select, I mean perhaps in the user interface, perhaps by the order in which you do it and perhaps also you can just say, this is the main, the reference point
Usability and User Interface;Should it be in the main window
Usability and User Interface;shown on the bottom in this wa
Usability and User Interface;so some tool, so something like this have zoom and you can zoom in and out and then in some window for example the left, you see, where you are located in the complete picture right now something
Usability and User Interface;so we have like a view of the intersection and then you can set I mean up or down or left and right will be this I mean ok up and down will be green 30
Usability and User Interface;some other kind of symbol
Usability and User Interface;Something like this, itís difficult with the ???, so we could actually draw some kind of car symbol there and so currently itís a busy road when there are lotís of cars and if itís a seldom used road when itís just from time to time a car appears
Usability and User Interface;the user clicks somewhere in this area, what we do is that he can, that the user clicks there that we can let him define this number of the frequency
Usability and User Interface;they can draw intersections with a specific kind of symbol
Usability and User Interface;user can do some kind of action in a certain range
Usability and User Interface;user doesnít need to draw a new kind of symbol as similar to the
Usability and User Interface;want to put a play button somewhere, or start simulation button somewhere so having defined the world, have set the traffic lights and the car spawning behavior, that user can actually start the simulation, I donít know, I am just drawing
Usability and User Interface;was thinking ok you can have a drop down menu which had and all the other signals
Usability and User Interface;Weíd also like to provide the possibility to draw an intersection in addition to that to simplify drawing the intersection
Usability and User Interface;With this slidebar at the bottom, or so something like this
Usability and User Interface;would need to be detected so that if the user performs this action in this range then we allow him for spawning cars and so on, define this car-related behavior.
Usability and User Interface;would you also like some possibility to zoom in and out, corresponding to the smart-board software so that you can perhaps see anything
Usability and User Interface;Yeah, but maybe I mean so that the user of this system should be able to define this symbol behaviors
Use Case;I mean if you draw road here it should, you should be able to draw like this and then if you draw a road over it
Use Case;must be able to design each intersection with or without the option of sensors that detect whether any car are present on a given lane
Use Case;Ok, yeah, so right now the students can basically draw roads and a road as they wish as long as they want and whatever where they want and they can draw intersections with a specific kind of symbol.
Use Case;So first of all the students have to be able to draw traffic light systems
Use Case;so the user does this and this here then you want to create new cars.
Use Case;that the user can basically decide, where to put it and create as many cars as he likes to
Use Case;the approach to let the user create an intersection with sensors and without sensors,
Use Case;The thing is that the user would say ok, I describe the behavior of this right now and then this should take this into account
Use Case;the user can decide whether itís an intersection with sensors or without sensors
Use Case;the user has to define it up front and just let it simulate without any changes or whether he should be able to start the simulation and then, if he decides to, notices there are not enough cars, wants to have 200 more, so that he can spawn new cars, while the simulation is being done
Use Case;use the road symbol and also draw intersections like this then of course we would need to allow him to draw traffic light symbols in addition to that
Use Case;user need to be able to define in our simplified version?
